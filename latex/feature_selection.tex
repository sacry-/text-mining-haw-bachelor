  ``Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge. "Applied machine learning" is basically feature engineering.''
}}{ Andrew Ng }

This section is about engineering the right features for clustering that contain enough information to firstly represent the document itself and secondly to link documents to each other. To do so the document domain of newspapers will be discussed. 
The feature selection process of a document by taking several processing steps is examined.
At the heart: How can we expand the knowledge of a feature set by adding semantics to it?
