    ("economics", "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story All the Republican presidential candidates say they want to make the tax code simpler. But no candidate has been more aggressive about simplicity than Carly Fiorina, who says “our tax code needs to go from 73,000 pages down to about three pages.” To be clear, Mrs. Fiorina is not calling for a three-page tax return. She is saying the entire tax law of the federal government — and apparently the accompanying regulations, since the Internal Revenue Code itself is 3,728 pages — should be just a little longer than this article. On Tuesday, she pointed on Facebook to one way she thinks that could be done: by putting in place a tax plan proposed by the economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, who have produced draft legislation for a single-rate income tax that runs just 1,120 words. “Reporters said it wasn’t possible,” wrote Sarah Isgur Flores, Mrs. Fiorina’s deputy campaign manager, on Twitter. “Once again, media was wrong.” Actually, Mrs. Fiorina is wrong. The Hall-Rabushka legislation is intended to replace not the entire Internal Revenue Code but just Subtitle A, which lays out rules about how much tax is due on what income. That would still leave Subtitles B through K, a further 1,445 pages describing taxes other than the income tax, and setting out important administrative matters like what happens if you don’t pay your taxes. Those pages would need to be retained or replaced with new law, unless Mrs. Fiorina wants the Internal Revenue Service to make up its own rules. Even replacing just Subtitle A with the three-page Hall-Rabushka version could cause significant problems. ”The minute it’s passed, I’m going to call my dean and tell her to pay me only in goods,” said Michael J. Graetz, a tax professor at Columbia Law School. “Buy me a house, buy me some groceries every week, buy me meals.” That’s because the three-page plan avoids complex rules about fringe benefits by saying noncash compensation is tax-free. That said, while the tax code can’t be reduced to three pages, it could be significantly simpler than it is today, and Mrs. Fiorina and most of her opponents have identified a source of both length and complexity: so-called tax preferences. Advertisement Continue reading the main story When a provision of the tax code says one thing will be taxed and another thing will not, taxpayers are encouraged to contort their lives to do more of the untaxed thing and less of the taxed thing, paying lawyers and accountants to keep the records along the way. “In my case, I have lawyers all over the place, I have accounting firms all over the place,” Donald Trump said in August. Like all of his opponents, Mr. Trump says he would simplify the tax code by lowering tax rates and cutting the number of deductions and preferences offered. Unlike his opponents, he says his simplification would be so effective as to “put H&R Block out of business, knock ’em out, put ’em out of business.” But the candidates have missed the mark in a few ways. One is by conflating tax simplicity with the number of tax rates imposed by the I.R.S. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Simplify the income tax system to just three individual income tax rates, instead of the current six,” urges Gov. Chris Christie’s tax plan, although the actual number of tax brackets is seven. But having too many tax brackets is not why it’s hard to do taxes. Once you know what your taxable income is, applying the right tax rates is simple arithmetic that tax software will do for you. If you make less than $100,000, you don’t even need to do arithmetic; you can read your tax liability on the convenient tax tables published by the I.R.S. What make taxes complex are all the rules that determine your taxable income in the first place. The candidates’ plans would simplify the taxable income calculation, but they have been hesitant to make this calculation too simple for a reason: That would require taking away tax deductions, and people tend to like the deductions they take. Most Republican candidates, including Mr. Trump, have said their plans to attack tax preferences would not touch two of the biggest and most popular ones: deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable giving. So far, the candidate most committed to tax simplification may be Ben Carson, who advocated abolishing the deduction for charitable giving at Tuesday’s debate. Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have also proposed simple tax plans that would not only shrink the personal income tax and repeal most deductions but also abolish payroll taxes and the corporate income tax, replacing them with a value-added tax, which is kind of like a national sales tax. In other countries, VATs tend to be quite complex, with different rates for different kinds of transactions and with many industries (like health care and education) exempted. But the VATs conceived by Mr. Paul and Mr. Cruz are supposed to apply broadly and equally across the whole economy, which would make them easy for businesses to comply with, and would also mean they could raise a lot of revenue, far outstripping the income tax. Other candidates’ plans are not so simple. Senator Marco Rubio and Mr. Trump would both introduce a significant new source of complexity by taxing small-business profits at a lower rate than wage income; currently, they are taxed at the same rate. This change would encourage taxpayers to find ways to recharacterize their income as profits instead of wages, perhaps by becoming independent contractors. It would also require the I.R.S. to issue new rules about what is a wage and what is a profit, complicating life for people who have bona fide business income. There is also one approach to simplification that hasn’t been proposed by any of the Republican candidates: having the I.R.S. complete most people’s tax returns for them, requiring changes only if there is an error. This is already done in countries like Denmark and Spain. Tax complexity isn’t about just how many rules there are, but also about how many of those rules taxpayers actually have to confront. Auto-completion of tax forms would reduce complexity (and time and cost) as experienced by real people. One challenge with such a system is that tax returns depend not just on information known to the I.R.S. — such as the wages your employer reports on form W-2 — but on information it may not know, like your charitable giving. But if the tax code were simpler, with fewer deductions, it would be possible for the government to prepare an accurate, completed return for a greater share of tax filers. A change like that, along with simpler tax rules, might really put H&R Block out of business."),
    ("world", "Jeremy Corbyn has said it would have been far better if the Islamic State executioner Mohammed Emwazi had faced a trial in the courts rather than being killed on the streets of Syria. In a statement released soon after the prime minister had spoken outside Downing Street, Corbyn said the strike against Emwazi underlined the need for greater international efforts to bring an end to the civil war in Syria. “It appears Mohammed Emwazi has been held to account for his callous and brutal crimes. However, it would have been far better for us all if he had been held to account in a court of law. Related: Will killing Mohammed Emwazi have any effect on Isis? “These events only underline the necessity of accelerating international efforts, under the auspices of the UN, to bring an end to the Syrian conflict as part of a comprehensive regional settlement,” he said. The Labour leader’s words were in contrast to David Cameron’s expression of thanks to the US military following reports of a drone strike against Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, in Raqqa. The Labour leader’s views generated a sharp debate among some of the party’s MPs, with some opposing his position and others warning of the consequences of a growing number of extrajudicial killings. One MP, Ian Austin, apparently mocked his party leader on social media.Following Corbyn’s statement, Austin, the MP for Dudley North, tweeted: “Well done to UK & USA military & security personnel who’ve made sure barbaric murderer Mohammed Emwazi can’t slaughter anyone else. Mohammed Emwazi, pictured on his student ID card issued by the University of Westminster. Photograph: Rex Features “How do people who think Emwazi should have been put on trial think this could have happened & how many others would he kill in the meantime?’ He added: “Look, why couldn’t the police just go an [sic] arrest Emwazi? It’s not as if it’s a really dangerous war zone & I’m sure he’d have come quietly.” Corbyn found support from one Labour member of the foreign affairs select committee, who accused many of getting excited by extrajudicial killings. Yasmin Qureshi, MP for Bolton South East, told the Guardian that the late, former Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević committed genocide and killed thousands of people, but was properly arrested and tried. “That is what we should do with all these people. That is what the victims’ families ask for,” she said. “This new trend of celebrating and getting excited about extrajudicial killings of individuals, which are becoming commonplace, flies in the face of our principles of the rule of law.” In an echo of Corbyn’s previous statements, in which he questioned the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden by US special forces, Qureshi said the al-Qaida leader should have stood trial. “Bin Laden could have been captured and made to stand trial like Nazi war criminals and those in the former Yugoslavia. They killed millions more people but were not shot dead before arrest,” she said. John Woodcock MP, who chairs the internal Labour party defence committee, said the public will be relieved that Emwazi is dead. “The public will be relieved that Mohammed Emwazi is longer able to commit sickening war crimes for his masters to broadcast round the world,” he said. “Emwazi chose to become a killer in a conflict zone and his death sends a clear message to brainwashed Brits thinking of joining the extremists’ campaign of terror,.” Woodcock also criticised those opposed to Britain bombing Isis targets in Syria – a position held by Corbyn. “It is notable that the UK had to rely on others to target him because the government chose not to extend its action against Isis across the non-existent Syrian border,” he told the Independent. Corbyn has been criticised for his views on the way in which the US has killed rather than captured its enemies. In 2011, he suggested it was a “tragedy” that al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden had been “assassinated” rather than being brought before the courts. Speaking to Press TV following bin Laden’s death, he said there appeared to have been no attempt to arrest the al-Qaida leader and put him on trial, adding: “This was an assassination attempt, and is yet another tragedy, upon a tragedy, upon a tragedy. The World Trade Center was a tragedy, the attack on Afghanistan was a tragedy, the war in Iraq was a tragedy.”"),
    ("world", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story A story this week about an 8-year-old boy in Birmingham, Ala., charged with the murder of a 1-year-old girl who had been left with him while her mother went to a nightclub, sparked intense debate among Times readers about who should be held accountable when a child commits a crime. Some readers expressed sympathy for the girl’s mother, who has been charged with manslaughter in the death of her daughter: “Is it really relevant that the mother was at a nightclub? What if this had happened while she was at Bible study? It would be just as awful,” said Karen of Philadelphia. “That we do so little to support young mothers is a greater shame than that a limited young woman might make a terrible mistake.” “[T]here is something unseemly about this vociferous condemnation of the baby’s mother. It seems underpinned by the assumption that this woman is the most selfish and stupid and dreadful person imaginable … We know nothing about her except that she left them alone,” said LR of New York. But other readers felt the mother of the 1-year-old girl as well as the 8-year-old boy’s mother — who was not identified in the article and has not been charged in the case — bore the ultimate responsibility: “Kids need supervision. Constantly,” said Ponderer of Mexico City. “Whoever left the six kids alone is responsible for this killing.” “You wonder what’s wrong with an 8-year-old who’d beat a toddler to death,” said Siobhan of New York. “And then you realize that the two adults in this scenario thought it was appropriate to leave him in charge of a bunch of younger kids, including a baby, so they could go bar hopping.” “This gross negligence is what led to the death of that baby. … I think they should throw the book at them,” said NMY of New Jersey. Several readers speculated about the circumstances leading to the boy’s violent reaction: “The probability is very high that this boy simply did what he had seen adults doing in the same situation and what had been done to him,” said AliceP of Leesburg, Va. “Some young children push and shove but rarely does a child beat another child to death,” said Linda of Oklahoma. “It makes you wonder what kinds of things these young children have witnessed in their lives.” A central question for readers was the culpability of an 8-year-old and whether a child that young can even understand the charges against him: “An 8-year-old is definitely not old enough to fully understand the ramifications of his actions. That is why 8 years of age is too young to be left on one’s own, let alone with younger children,” said CM of North Carolina. “They send grown adults home with ‘don’t shake your baby’ fliers because screaming babies are just that hard to cope with for some ears,” said Elizabeth of Seattle. “He never should have been left to his own devices.” “This child, and I repeat, child, did not and cannot comprehend the gravity of his actions nor the state’s reaction,” said Bo of Washington, D.C. But Baron95 of Westport, Conn., said, “I have an 8-year-old. And I can guarantee you that she knows full well that beating a crying baby is wrong.” For many readers, the case served as evidence of the grim challenges facing modern American culture: Elizabeth of Toronto said, “I suggest using the next five years to educate both the mother and the children, in child care, in life skills; in all the stuff we lucky people take for granted. We need improvement here, and money, example, time, kindness and help are the currencies.” “A society in which tiny kids kill one another should feel guilty. But it should deal with the real issue and fix that,” said KJ of New York. “It takes a village to raise a child, and also to so horrifically fail a child — in this case two children.”"),
    ("sports", "Pre-tournament training camps have always been a vital ingredient for success on the international stage. World Cup 2014 winners Germany trained in Italy before travelling to Brazil. The previous champions, Spain, trained in Austria before going to South Africa. Even the inaugural World Cup winners, Uruguay, spent the four weeks preceding the 1930 tournament in a training camp. It was little surprise, then, when the Cuban national team embarked on a training camp before the 1970 Central American and Caribbean (CAC) Games. What was surprising was the choice of location: North Korea. Despite a distance of 7,800 miles between Havana and Pyongyang, Cuba and North Korea were close. They had been allies ever since the Bay of Pigs crisis in 1961, having established embassies in each other’s capital cities in the aftermath of the crisis. Che Guevara even visited Pyongyang in the December of the previous year, one of his first diplomatic visits since securing power with Castro in 1959. While Castro’s determination to beat the US at its own game would lead to football suffering at the expense of sports such as baseball and boxing, it received initial support from Cuba’s new leaders. Several EIDEs – Sporting Initiation Schools – were set up around the island in 1961 to identify and train emerging sporting talents, including footballers. Despite investment in football’s infrastructure, Cuba underperformed in the 1960s. A third-place finish at the 1966 CAC Games was the sole achievement, but even that was overshadowed by the team’s poor performance in qualifying for England’s World Cup that same year. Cuba had finished bottom of a less than stellar group containing Jamaica and Netherlands Antilles, thus missing out on what would have been their second appearance at the World Cup finals after participating at France 1938 (where they lost to Sweden 8-0 in the quarter-finals). Accordingly, in 1969 the suits of Cuban football followed the well trodden path of any struggling national team. They appointed a foreign manager. The man tasked with turning the investment in the up-and-coming youngsters emerging from the EIDEs into appearances on the podium was Kim Yong-Ha of North Korea, and his first move as national team manager was to embark on a tour of his homeland with his adopted team. It was hardly a short adventure for the squad of 27 players, most of whom had never left Cuba before, never mind the tropical climate of the Caribbean. The tour lasted not a few days, a week or even a fortnight, but was six whole months of intense physical training and strict diet. Perhaps inevitably, the tour didn’t get off to a great start; homesickness crept in and the alien culture affected the players. One of the stars of that Cuban team was forward Andrés Roldán, who later explained: “The limited knowledge we had of Korea, coupled with the inconvenience of not understanding the language and the draining long trip, meant that the unity of the group was affected.” Even worse was that three players had to return home. Right-back Rafael Rodríguez Arguelles returned to Cuba after falling ill, while striker Jorge Massó also had to return to undergo surgery after breaking a toe in his right foot. More serious was the departure of central defender and captain Gregorio “Goyo” Dalmau, who returned home after suffering a nervous breakdown. With the fulcrum of the team returning home for the most preoccupying of reasons, with players feeling homesick and with language barriers proving problematic, one could have been forgiven for thinking the trip was going to be a disaster. The 19-year-old Roldán took over the captain’s armband following Goyo’s return home and, despite his inexperience, he was able to steer the ship back on course. That was thanks in large part to the coaching tandem of manager Kim Yong-Ha and his Cuban assistant Sergio Padrón Moreno. The latter provided the motivation for the group of players, having been in their position a decade previously when he was the player of the tournament at the 1957 CAC Games, earning him a far from common acknowledgement from the Cuban government as one of the sportspeople of the year. Having managed capital city club La Habana to Cuban National Championship success in 1965, Moreno also knew several of the players well and he was a key link between the playing squad and manager Kim. The relationship between Moreno and Kim was surprisingly good, given Kim’s limited Spanish and Moreno’s non-existent Korean. The Cuban had only good things to say about the man he would succeed just a year later: “He was the best foreign coach to ever sit on the bench of the Cuban national team. Kim knew a lot about technique. He imposed a great tactical discipline and got the best out of every player. Those six months were very fruitful.” The praise for the man unknown to any member of the Cuban contingent just months previously was echoed by captain Roldán: “Kim had a universal football vision. He liked his Latin football and quickly gained the confidence of the players.” That confidence was enhanced as Cuba went from victory to victory on their tour of North Korea. The trend continued when the contingent set off for a spell in war-torn Vietnam upon leaving North Korea, in a way stepping out of the frying pan and into the fire. In Moreno’s own words: “We set off for a country in the midst of war with quite a large group. They welcomed us with great affection and we played matches in seven or eight cities in the north of the country.” Highlighting the hostile atmosphere in which the Cubans were preparing for the CAC Games, on one occasion the players took a break after lunch to rest for the evening’s match with a local Vietnamese team. That was when the air sirens sounded; a fleet of American B-52 planes were approaching. The whole squad and the residents of the village took refuge from their common enemy in the hastily built and cramped underground tunnels. It was not a short wait either, with the all-clear to emerge not given until several hours later. Fortunately, however, all safely emerged and all safely returned to Cuba. It may have been unconventional preparation for a tournament held in Panama, but the hard work and sacrifices invested into the tour paid off the following summer when Cuba ended a 40-year wait between gold medals at Panama’s 1970 CAC Games. Despite a 2-1 defeat to Colombia in their opening match and falling 3-0 behind to the hosts in their second, the steely resilience welded during the Asian tour saw the Cubans come back in the second half to defeat Panama 4-3 before concluding the group stage with a 4-0 win over Nicaragua to progress. Two wins out of three in the next and final round, also a group stage, saw Cuba crowned champions ahead of Netherlands Antilles, Colombia – later disqualified for fielding an ineligible player – and Venezuela. It was their first regional footballing title under the new Castro government. Kim Yong-Ha was heralded as a hero in Cuba; he was the exotic master tactician who had surely now ushered in a new era of success in Cuban football. More success was to follow and the 1970s became the most fruitful decade in the history of Cuban football. They won the bronze medal at the Pan American Games of 1971, after which Kim returned to North Korea, leaving Sergio Padrón Moreno to take over the reins and complete the project Kim had started. Moreno did so with great success, winning the following two CAC Games in 1974 and 1978, as well as the honour of taking Cuba to the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Cuba’s first ever Olympic appearance on the football field. Despite bowing out in the first round, Moreno’s Cuba earned a memorable goalless draw with tournament favourites, defending Olympic champions and 1974 World Cup bronze medallists Poland. They could even have won the match had a Cuban goal not been wrongly, according to the Cubans, chalked off for offside. The following Olympics brought even greater triumph as Cuba qualified for the quarter-finals in 1980, one of Moreno’s last acts as manager before stepping back from the dugout and into the Cuban Football Association’s offices in 1981. The legacy he and Kim Yong-Ha left behind has never been emulated, although that is not for lack of trying. Another Korean tour followed in 1985 under new manager Roberto “Nene” Hernández and was, like the 1969 tour, followed with a CAC Games gold medal the following year. The success was not as prolonged this time, however, and Cuban football has never returned to its peak of the 1970s having regressed to the realms of the also-ran. Captain and star of the team Andrés Roldán explained at the height of that period that, “after winning in Panama and repeating the triumph in the Dominican Republic [CAC Games of 1974], we had become a daring and ambitious group, ready to go toe to toe with anyone, even the Poles, who were among the elite of world football.” In his manager’s eyes there was only one possible explanation for the success of the 1970s: the tour of North Korea and Vietnam. “As well as helping us to win the Central American and Caribbean Games of 1970,” Moreno has since suggested, “it acted as a good starting point and strengthened the competitive training of the group of players who would become the protagonists of the subsequent good results.” Spool forward to the present day and the lesson for current football associations is clear. For success at Russia 2018 and beyond, a six-month stint in Pyongyang is the key. The tickets are surely being booked at the FA’s offices as you read this.

    ("entertainment", "MGM has finally found the perfect person to fill Patrick Swayze’s roundhouse-kicking boots in the Road House remake: U.F.C. fighter Ronda Rousey. That’s right, Road House—that bastion of 80s masculinity—is getting a female lead. Hollywood is churning out more remakes, reboots, and retoolings than we can keep track of. But with Jurassic World dominating the global box office and Star Wars threatening to compete come Christmas, there’s no end to this craze in sight. But this gender flip is, at the very least, an interesting comment on the machismo of the original Road House. Variety reports that Rousey, who has not been shy at all about her Hollywood ambitions, wanted to be respectful of Swayze’s legacy and made sure to get a blessing from Swayze’s widow before taking on the role. It seemed inevitable that Rousey would break out in Hollywood in a big way. The fighter’s popularity has skyrocketed in the last year with an astonishing 16-second win, a no-holds-barred approach to red-carpet interviews, and a viral feminist speech that was quickly adopted by none other than Beyoncé all leading Hollywood to hope they might have another Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson on their hands. And though Rousey has popped up briefly in a few films including The Expendables 3, Furious 7, and Entourage, all of those appearances were essentially fight scenes and there’s no proof, yet, that the abundant charisma Rousey exudes in interviews will translate on the big screen. Hollywood, it seems, is willing to take a gamble on that charisma; Road House is actually the fourth big project Rousey is attached to. She’ll be part of an all-female Delta Force team in The Athena Project, appear alongside Mark Wahlberg in Mile 22, and star as herself in a biopic based on her best-selling autobiography, My Fight/Your Fight. There will, however, be a lot of added pressure on the untested Rousey when it comes to a beloved cult film like Road House. But the original Road House is essentially one long bar fight, with Swayze playing a bouncer hired to clean up one of the rowdiest bars in Missouri. Rousey, who played a bouncer in The Expendables 3, can likely knock this one out in her sleep. Road House is only the latest classic Swayze movie to get the remake treatment, with a new Point Break skydiving into theaters this Christmas. But beyond the reboot craze, Road House is also part of a gender-swapping sub-trend sweeping Hollywood. Mad Max: Fury Road was, essentially, a sneakily gender-bent reboot of the George Miller’s Road Warrior franchise. When you add Emilia Clarke’s tough-as-nails Sarah Connor in Terminator: Genysis and the ladies rocking Paul Fieg’s the Ghostbusters reboot, we officially have a trend. Ronda Rousey’s Road House won’t start filming until 2016, in the meantime you can either bust out that old VHS copy of the Swayze original, take a gamble on the straight-to-video 2006 sequel, Road House 2: Last Call, or start dreaming of Rousey sporting a Swayze mullet. I know what I’d pick."),
    ("health", "Mexico City – like the rest of the country – is in the grip of an obesity crisis. While the reasons for this are far from black and white, close analysis suggests that a lack of physical activity could be the main contributing factor. In 2013, Mexico responded to its (literally) growing problem by introducing taxes on food and drink with a high sugar or fat content, becoming something of an international case study. While this has been successful in raising money for the government, the health impacts of the “sugar tax” are not yet scientifically proven. The move was prompted by reports such as the 2012 National Survey of Health and Nutrition, which found that in greater Mexico City, almost seven million people were overweight and five million people were clinically obese – a total of 56% of the city’s population of around 21 million people. As hard as it is to compare these numbers with those in other Mexican cities (due to the lack of representative data for smaller cities), we can say that if Mexico City were a state, officially it would be the most overweight state in the entire country. Between 2000 and 2012, adult obesity has shown a steady upward trend in the capital, where it affected 16% of the city population in 2000, 19% in 2006, and 26% in 2012. In 2012, more women (28%) than men (24%) were found to be obese in central Mexico City, while 35% of children aged five–11 were either overweight or obese. The consequences of these numbers could be devastating: Mexico’s health ministry has warned that if the problem is not addressed, the life expectancy of future generations will probably go down. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A 16-year-old boy attends a medical consultation at a Mexico City hospital for symptoms related to severe morbid obesity. Photograph: Sipa/Rex Shutterstock According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a high body mass index is a modifiable risk factor for developing noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and even some types of cancer (endometrial, breast and colon). Children may also suffer an increased risk of developing early markers of cardiovascular diseases and insulin resistance, as well as psychological effects. In 2012, central Mexico City already had the highest rates of diagnosed diabetes and hypertension in the country – respectively, 10% and 22% of the total population. But high as these rates are, the numbers could rise significantly if the proportion of patients who don’t even know that they are ill is taken into account. Earlier, national figures for 2006 had shown that the prevalence of both diabetes and hypertension almost doubled when undiagnosed rates were added. If statistics follow a similar trend, then Mexico – including the capital – could soon be facing an overwhelming health problem. Why is the city getting fatter? Obesity is a complex health issue. While its direct causes are commonly linked to eating behaviour and physical activity, a wide variety of underlying factors can influence individual choices. To gauge some of these factors, the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness developed a tool that uses state-level data to identify risks and opportunities, shedding light on some interesting facts that contribute to a greater understanding of the obesity problem. While food is an important part of Mexican culture (since 2010, the cuisine has been recognised by Unesco as an “intangible cultural heritage”), the capital was recognised as having the country’s highest concentration of street trade in 2010, almost certainly leading to an increased consumption of food of low nutritional value. But the Federal District was also among the eight states that registered the lowest purchases of goods with a high sugar, fat or salt content. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Surveys have found that few Mexican children exercise regularly. Photograph: Alamy Even the diets of newborn babies might bear some influence: in Mexico City in 2012, just 9% of babies from zero to six months were breastfed exclusively, compared with 14% of babies in the rest of the country. However, while the precise nature of the city’s dietary problems is hard to pin down, the picture regarding physical activity is much clearer. Put simply, the Federal District is the most sedentary state in the country. In 2012, only 33% of children aged 10 to 14 years reported doing any significant form of exercise – dancing, or sports such as basketball and football – over the previous year, while 74% of children said they looked at a screen for more than three hours every day during the week. As for the adult population, last year 29% of workers were employed in sedentary jobs, either working in an office or sitting elsewhere in front of a screen. The explanation for this chronic lack of exercise probably lies with the urban environment – and the lifestyle that is encouraged – and discouraged – by the city’s structure and dynamics. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A fruit salad stall in Mexico City, where fresh food is sold on the streets alongside less health snacks. Photograph: Alamy Let’s test some hypotheses: 1. There’s no time to exercise In 2014, the average person in central Mexico City worked 42 hours a week. This number is slightly above the national average of 41 hours; higher, too, than most member-countries of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) – behind only Turkey, Korea and South Africa. At the same time, commuting times are too long: in 2009, the city’s secretary of transportation estimated that an “average commuter” took one hour and 21 minutes to reach their destination. If every day, a typical employee spends 11 hours commuting and working, that doesn’t leave much free time to do exercise, cook good food, or spend time with the family. Both factors could also explain why, in 2012, almost 31% of citizens aged between 15 and 69 in central Mexico City were found to sleep six or fewer hours each night. 2. Traffic blocks an active lifestyle Between 2007 and 2014, the number of cars in the centre of the city grew considerably, by 39%, despite its population falling by 1.1% over the same period. Such unfettered growth in car use underlines Mexico City’s negative reputation for traffic levels, affecting not only its drivers but those using public transport. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Mexico City skyline seen from Chapultepec Park, the city’s largest green space. Photograph: Alamy According to IBM, in 2013 Mexico City was the most painful city in which to commute, factoring in its emotional and economic toll in comparison with 20 other cities around the world. A year later, 43% of the city’s public transport users said that those services were too slow. In an effort to encourage more active means of transportation, in 2010 the city introduced a bicycle-sharing programme, Ecobici, which to date has almost 176,000 users (equivalent to 3% of the central city’s total population). Likewise, in 2013, 7% of federal funds earmarked for mobility were used to increase pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure. Yet, traffic levels continue to rise. 3. Green spaces are too few and often shut To an outside observer, it might seem odd that inhabitants of Mexico City have access to infrastructure for physical activity, yet most of them do not use it. By 2014, for example, an estimated 87% of the capital’s urban sprawl had exercise facilities such as gyms and dance academies – the highest concentration in the country. The amount of green space is more limited. According to the city government, central Mexico City possesses 5.4 square metres of green spaces per inhabitant. The WHO recommends there should be between nine and 16 square metres per inhabitant. Chapultepec is the city’s most iconic and visited park. However, one third of it opens only from 5am to 8pm, and another section is closed on Mondays for maintenance. The other two big parks, Bosque de Aragón and Bosque de Tlalpan, have even shorter opening hours, closing no later than 6pm every day.

Fear stops residents being more active While Mexico City has not been as affected by insecurity as other regions, there are signs that crime has influenced its inhabitants’ habits and perceptions when it comes to adopting a more active lifestyle. In 2013, the National Survey of Victimisation and Perception of Crime found that 32% of respondents avoided walking on the street for fear of becoming a victim of crime. In addition, 82% of respondents said they would not allow their children to go out unattended – which might explain why the city’s children spend most of their free time playing video games, rather than those of the outdoor variety. A bitter pill The Mexican government has made many attempts to fight the pervasive weight problem, attracting international attention for its implementation of a national tax of one peso for sugar-sweetened beverages, and an 8% price rise on high-calorie foods such as ice-cream, chocolates and confectionary. Recently, the house of Congress approved halving the tax of those beverages containing only 5 grams of sugar per 100ml. This measure aims to be an incentive for the industry to provide more healthy options. Both taxes were introduced in January 2014, and have proven immediately successful as a fiscal measure, at least. In the first year, total income for both taxes exceeded the treasury’s forecast by 76%, collecting almost 32bn pesos. Preliminary results from a study by the National Institute of Public Health suggest an average reduction of 6% of sugar-sweetened beverages at the end of 2014, in comparison to the trend before the tax was implemented However, up-to-date results from neither this study nor one by the Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM) have been released. The introduction of these taxes generated a huge polemic nationwide. While the national government regards the policy as a big step forward in the fight against obesity, the food and drinks industry is still coming to terms with the move. Many want a greater proportion of the money raised to be channeled into preventative actions: “Some advocacy groups are requesting doubling the tax rate to enhance reductions in consumption,” says Juan Luis García, a health reporter based on Mexico City. At a national level, “it is likely that most people have felt the changes in prices, but they are not aware of the reasons,” García adds. “They know that taxed products are more expensive, but not all of them link it with health issues.” What is abundantly clear is that – even if the sugar tax does prove successful, Mexico City still needs to take action to incentivise people to adopt more active lifestyles. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The city has introduced a machine that rewards squats with tickets for the metro. Photograph: Andrea Sosa Cabrios/Alamy The city’s health ministry recently installed exercise machines at metro stations that exchange a certain number of squats for tickets. The current administration has also made efforts to build open, urban gyms – the current total stands at 366 – and rehabilitate public areas for exercising. At weekends, a civic programme called Muévete y Métete en Cintura attempts to guide the population towards more healthy lifestyles and physical activity. Despite these efforts, however, the data shows that more action is still needed to make the city more suited to active lifestyles. Four critical steps to achieve this could be: 1. Incentivise (with the secretary of labour) the implementation of programmes to promote healthier lifestyles in firms – by facilitating the use of stairs in buildings, or forming agreements with nearby gyms. 2. Increase and improve public spaces to encourage walking. Such a programme would not require huge investment but could start by making streets more welcoming, with better pavements and less street trade. Related: Mexico’s latest way to beat the obesity epidemic: make commuters do squats for free subway tickets 3. Increase safety measures, adding more lighting and surveillance, to encourage people to exercise in public spaces. An increase in the perceived safety of parks might increase activity levels, especially among children. 4. Strengthen measures to increase the capacity and quality of public transportation, and invite people to walk and cycle more. Given the urgency and pervasiveness of the national obesity crisis, Mexico City needs to take the lead in promoting healthier lifestyles for its inhabitants.But to achieve this objective, the underlying factors that reduce physical activity and diminish the quality of people’s diets must be addressed. Mexico City is an engine of economic growth for the country. To ensure that growth is not hampered by declining labour productivity and the increasing economic burden of disease, health should be at the core of the city’s development agenda for years to come.

    ("entertainment", "There are lots of things Spike Trotman is good at: drawing, telling stories, curating a collection of sex-positive erotic comics directed at women and running a small business called Iron Circus Comics, which has become Chicago’s largest independent comics publisher. The business may have made Trotman “internet-famous” as a producer of independent art, but her path to success is singular: she has never been able to follow the rules. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Spike Trotman. Fifteen years ago, Trotman got into the prestigious School of the Art Institute of Chicago. At the time, it looked like a coup, but the school placed a condition on her admission: she first had to undergo an additional qualifying year. It was a bad sign. Comics have had an odd trajectory as an art form in America: memorized like catechism by their fans, but not regarded by the high-minded as a proper art. Back in 2000, Trotman says the faculty were of this view, and things came to a head when her faculty adviser called her in for a meeting and more or less advised her to uglify her own work. There was too much detail, too much realism, they complained. Her pictures actually looked like something. “She said, ‘You know what you need to do? Get a canvas and put it against the wall. Are you right-handed? OK. Take a broom handle and tie a paintbrush to [it], and put it in your left hand, and then put your back to the canvas. And paint that way!’” she recalls. Trotman is a practical person; as she’s telling this story, her voice gets higher and higher to emphasize the absurdity of the instruction. And though she says she finished the year, from that moment she knew she wouldn’t go on into a master’s program; she just didn’t fit there. Templar, Arizona by Spike Trotman. Her taste was not likely to appeal to a commercial publisher, either. So she turned, instead, to what was then the wild, untested option: drawing a webcomic. At the time, in the early 2000s, the idea of a webcomic was seen as plain crazy. The first work Trotman put online was a slice-of-life comic drawn in sepia-tone called Templar, Arizona. People loved it. A Village Voice review described the plot as a comic following “the lives of young alternative newspaper columnist Ben Kowalski and some other residents of Templar, a post-apocalyptic city that blends ancient Rome and Egypt, Charles Dickens’s London, and the sexy, sporty metropolis of Maxim magazine”. The concept is indeed amusing and bizarre in the best way possible, and one can see why a larger commercial publisher might have balked: it doesn’t exactly have clear heroes and villains, and Trotman’s sense of humor has a twisted edge to it. It displays what would become a hallmark of Trotman’s work, a world populated by all sorts of different bodies and types – an issue that she would tackle more directly with her smut collection, Smut Peddler. Her work also pays attention to issues of money and class in a way you rarely see directly addressed in American art; another of her projects is a book called Poorcraft, which in illustrated panels provides tips on how to survive on less, right down to recipes for household cleaners made out of cheap ingredients. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An extract from Smut Peddler (2012). Trotman has always been very open about how she funded these ventures. At first, she simply published Templar on the web, on a domain she owned. She put up a “tip jar” link beside it, as well as a little thermometer, and told her readers that for every $200 she was able to raise, she’d update an additional time a week. She was surprised to see how rapidly people responded to her request. At the time, Trotman says, spending money over the internet was scary. Many people thought internet villains would “instantly eat your credit card number and run off with it to Best Buy and get 15 big screens”. But readers were willing, in her case, to take the risk. It wasn’t a huge amount of money (Trotman had a spouse who supported her work), but it was starting to impress her. When Kickstarter came around in 2009, it was a natural fit. She set up a project to fund a print version of Templar, which ended up being funded well over what she had asked for. She decided here and there to use crowdfunding as a kind of angel investor for her work. With this model, Trotman says she now sells about $250,000 worth of comics a year. This year, she will publish four comics; she’s hoping to get that up to six. And then there is Smut Peddler, one of her biggest successes. Inspired by a prior collection of erotic comics, Trotman decided to create her own anthology of alternative pornography. She did so after noticing that many erotic comics were produced by straight men, for straight men. “People think there are no porno comics out there being made ‘for them’, and I wanted to prove that there are,” she says. She called sympathetic friends and acquaintances to ask if they would be willing to draw for her. They were – in fact, “It was like they were springloaded. Like they had been waiting all their lives for someone to ask them to write dirty comics.” Smut Peddler, 2012 edition. Photograph: Blue Delliquanti The anthology she produced speaks to a cornucopia of sexual tastes. In some instances the settings are high fantasy (Trotman herself drew an erotic story based on the Annunciation of Christian theology – the moment where the archangel Gabriel tells the Virgin Mary she will give birth to Jesus); in others, simple scenarios are used (for example, a lesbian couple negotiates their BDSM agreement). The anthology was instantly popular, and in response to her few detractors, Trotman says the demographics speak for themselves. “The readership of comics has exploded in the last few years. Comics is headed for definitely more than parity – majority women. All of the NYT bestselling comics and graphic novels out there are by women, and they’re being read by girls. It’s in the pipe.” She is disdainful of what she rightly calls “the reactionary, open-mouthed shock in a lot of media, where women’s concerns are actually being given a place at the table”. “I have been subjected to moving goalposts my entire career,” Trotman says with a laugh. “I could win the Nobel Prize next week, and they’d write a five-paragraph article on how I didn’t deserve it and it doesn’t count.” So, as she’s always done, Trotman says she’s just going her own way. “I want my entire career in comics to be a metaphor for that moment in the Anaconda video when Nicki Minaj slaps Drake’s hand away from her butt, and walks away laughing,” Trotman said.

    ("entertainment", "As a young Frenchman visiting New York in the 1970s, Jean-Luc Choplin sat through the Broadway revival of the Leonard Bernstein comedic operetta Candide and was “utterly enchanted”. When the curtains fell he found himself walking the streets of New York singing numbers from the show. Choplin vowed to himself that one day, when he had his own theatre, he would stage the musical adaptation of Voltaire’s satirical novel. Three decades on, Choplin took over Paris’s imperial Théâtre du Châtelet, and made Candide his first production. Since then, the French director has been on a mission to bring Broadway to the boulevards in the original English. In 2007, Candide was followed by West Side Story, and now every year he brings another musical classic, including The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, Sweeney Todd, The King and I and, later this month for the second time this year, Singin’ in the Rain. Paris’s theatregoers who once turned their noses up at the Anglo-Saxon comédie musicale, as a popular and thus lower genre, snap up tickets so hungrily that the shows are often sold out before they have opened. “When I started, people accused me of destroying the Châtelet, and said they wouldn’t ever come again. But then they saw a show and they’d be positively astonished to see something so completely different,” Choplin said. “It was as if they’d been struck by lightning and completely shaken out of their certainty about what they liked at the theatre and what they didn’t.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jean-Luc Choplin, whose first production was Candide. Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images Choplin says when he became director of the theatre, a grand building on the right bank of the river Seine built on the orders of Napoleon III’s chief architect, Baron Haussmann, he decided to drag into the 21st century. “It was another opera house in a city that already had several opera houses. I decided to change its DNA: I wanted it to be a place of music that was sophisticated but also popular, less elitist, and that put on theatre that was international,” he said. Not everyone was as enthusiastic. The Châtelet had been a venue for some of the classical world’s most celebrated dancers and musicians, including Vaslav Nijinsky, Anna Pavlova, Debussy, Ravel, Satie, Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Richard Strauss. “People were horrified. They said ‘you cannot do musicals, this will be a complete catastrophe’, and they pointed out that others had tried before and it had always been a flop. It was a risk, but I felt I had to try,” Choplin said. “Musicals were considered popular and Anglo-Saxon and there was a strong anti-Americanism back then in France, which has only recently come to an end.” Choplin recalls his insistence on putting on American musicals led one guest at a polite Parisian dinner party to accuse him of working for the CIA. The French had operetta, a precursor to musical theatre, but the distinction between the genres is blurred. The most simple definition is that operetta is light opera with acting, while musical theatre is plays with singing and dancing. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Musicals were considered popular and Anglo-Saxon and there was a strong anti-Americanism back then in France,’ Choplin says. Photograph: Jacques Demarthon/AFP/Getty Images Choplin is passionate about the so-called golden age of musicals on Broadway between the 1930s and 60s, an era that produced Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Rodgers and Hammerstein, George and Ira Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim. “I wanted to show that Bernstein, Sondheim, Rogers and Hammerstein were also great composers who had their place in a theatre that wanted to open its doors to a wider public,” he said. Surprisingly, at Châtelet musicals about 90% of the audiences are not expats or visiting tourists, but French. Surtitles – above the stage as opposed to subtitles below – help those who need it with the language. “We have to make sure we don’t send the surtitles through too quickly or the audience is laughing at the jokes before the actors have delivered the lines,” Choplin added. “But we’ve become expert at this. In all the time I’ve been here I haven’t had one single complaint about the performances being in English. The children who come to shows like The Sound of Music already know the songs in French so it’s not only entertainment, it’s an excellent English lesson.” Singin’ in the Rain, directed by the Canadian-born Robert Carsen, a graduate of the Old Vic theatre school in Bristol, presents additional challenges. Gene Kelly may have made it look easy in the classic 1952 film, but Choplin says it is harder than it seems: “We have to produce good rain that is wet, but warm enough so nobody catches a cold, make sure the orchestra doesn’t get a soaking and prevent the wet stage becoming slippery.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Choplin remains passionate about musicals on Broadway staged between the 1930s and 60s. Photograph: Jacques Demarthon/AFP/Getty Images Following the Châtelet’s success, several other theatres in Paris are now staging musicals. Cats, Flashdance, Dirty Dancing and the Legend of King Arthur are just a few running in the French capital. The Châtelet, the only major venue putting on musicals in English with a full symphony orchestra, believes it is still unique. In February it will stage its first Cole Porter musical with Kiss me, Kate. “It’s important the shows are in the original English. If you take something like Sondheim, the words are so directly and intrinsically linked to the musical notes, that it just doesn’t work in another language, “ Choplin said. “Children here sing a French version of ‘Doe, a deer, a female deer’ but it loses the original charm, and can be, frankly, ridiculous.” And as he and his team discovered with My Fair Lady: “the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain” confounds the most expert translator. Singin’ in the Rain will be at the Châtelet theatre in Paris from 27 November to 15 January."),
    ("entertainment", "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story Last Friday, something happened in network television that’s almost unheard-of these days: A show got canceled. The ABC drama “Wicked City” was the first show of the new television season, now nine weeks deep, to get the ax. Industry executives said it was the longest period in recent memory that it took so long for a show to go under. This is not because of the strength of the freshman class from the four major networks, which includes heavily marketed shows that have failed to draw big audiences, including “The Muppets” on ABC and “Scream Queens” on Fox. Instead, it speaks to a gripping anxiety that has spread throughout an industry where hits are in short supply and network officials are becoming extra cautious about dropping something too soon. To hear them talk about new shows this year, they sound less like cutthroat executives and more like forgiving teachers: That student may be flunking, but maybe, just maybe, he can turn things around. “In the old days you knew by the third or fourth week if a show truly had traction,” said Mark Pedowitz, the president of the CW Television Network. “You’re now looking at seven or eight episodes before you get a determination. You’ll know more come some time by December and January.” There are several reasons for this. Ratings are down across all of television, creating a level playing field where shows don’t have to stand out to survive. In between a few hits and a handful of shows on life support is a vast middle ground where even struggling programs can muddle on. There are also more shows than ever — more than 400 will appear across broadcast television, cable and online services by year’s end, setting a record, and viewers are inundated with options. Executives want to give an audience time to find a show. And the networks also have access to a sea of data and statistics packed with delayed viewing numbers where, if one looks closely enough, it’s possible to find flickering signs of promise. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Glenn Geller, the new president of CBS Entertainment, said in an interview that “in the last couple of years, and certainly this year, you just kind of have to give it more time.” “It’s going to take a little longer to evaluate the metrics,” he said. “The overnights are just not the complete picture anymore, and every viewer counts.” The only viewers that count significantly to advertisers are the ones that tune in within the first three days of a show’s airing. But those delayed viewing numbers have made executives more hesitant about canceling something that could be poised for a turnaround. “What if you have a ‘Seinfeld’ or ‘The Office,’ a show that you believe in and with nurturing and time, can find an audience?” said Warren Littlefield, the former president of NBC Entertainment. Instead of cancellations, networks have put shows with poor ratings on notice another way this year: by trimming back episode orders. That dubious distinction has befallen “Minority Report” on Fox, “Blood & Oil” on ABC and the NBC series “Truth Be Told” and “The Player.” It’s widely believed that shows whose episode orders are cut are all but finished. Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Wicked City,” however, earned its cancellation. A drama about serial killers starring Ed Westwick and Erika Christensen, it recorded a woeful 0.4 rating in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic in its third episode last week (that translates to about 567,000 viewers). That was enough to get the show removed outright. “When you get down to 0.4 rating, the notion of patience goes right out the window,” said Preston Beckman, a former executive at Fox and NBC who spent more than three decades in the industry. But anything resembling a decent ratings number will give a show some breathing room. Last year, ABC canceled “Manhattan Love Story” on Oct. 24 after four episodes, when the series finale failed to draw three million viewers. “Minority Report” lives on this season with an average of 2.1 million viewers through eight episodes, according to Nielsen. There have been a few standouts in this year’s rookie class. “Blindspot” on NBC, “Life in Pieces” and “Supergirl” on CBS and “Quantico” on ABC have all performed well, particularly when delayed viewing has been factored in. But even as executives beg for more patience, there aren’t many examples to prove delayed viewing makes hits out of would-be bombs. Delayed viewing data, Mr. Beckman said, usually proves that “the rich get richer and the poor get a little less poor.” “The networks have talked themselves into, ‘if you wait to get data and the video on demand and the this-and-that, the show that looked horrible doesn’t look as bad,’” he said. “I think it has to do with hoping against hope that delayed viewing will turn a questionable show into a renewable show, even though it usually doesn’t.” In recent years, as ratings began to decline, many of the networks tried to develop their shows in-house using a studio team owned by the parent company. If a network has an ownership stake in a show, it is more likely to give a show a chance to work. Photo “If we get these shows to a good place and let them find solid viewership and we get to sell them into syndication, they go into streaming, they go everywhere and suddenly it’s good for the good corporation,” Mr. Geller said. “And we get paid on both sides.” They get paid as a network because they have a hit, and then they’re paid for international rights and for streaming rights if they sell to Netflix or Amazon. A show like “Scream Queens,” with low same-day ratings but with solid returns from delayed viewing, could develop enough of a niche following to potentially appeal to a streaming service. Networks are also hesitant to cancel shows because they don’t have a deep bench of replacements. “The fact of the matter is that cancellations are very costly,” Mr. Littlefield said. “Most of the time when you cancel a show, and this is more true now than ever, the next thing you throw into that time period is going to do worse.” And with more viewers consuming their television in one fell swoop by binge-watching, Mr. Pedowitz said there was a greater inclination to give viewers time to play catch-up. “Bingeing has an impact when you get to the holiday season and people have a little bit more time,” he said. Mr. Geller said the industry historically knew what to do with a new show by Week 3. Now, the uncertainty lasts deeper into the fall schedule, and the old playbook is being revised. “The show comes on, you get a great premiere number, you keep your fingers crossed for next week, and normally you lose viewers but you expect a natural small decline,” Mr. Geller said. “By Week 3, you usually see where the show settles and you say, ‘This is it.’ Now it takes a little longer to know where the bottom is.”"),

But let’s forget about all that for a moment. The “Zoolander 2” trailer is here. If there were any doubts that a sequel to the 2001 Ben Stiller action comedy about a not-so-bright supermodel should have been made, they may be quelled by seeing Derek Zoolander flashing looks with names like Le Tigre, Magnum and Blue Steel. The new film looks to be as silly as the first, bringing back “Zoolander” alumni Owen Wilson as Hansel and Will Ferrell as the villain Mugatu, while adding Kristen Wiig and Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays an androgynous supermodel (named All) with deadpan vampiness.

    ("entertainment", "This week, I’m reviewing “Paintings of Cole,” which I didn’t like, because the press screening was all the way uptown, and there were huge delays on the J train. The movie, which was written and directed by Steven Kern, who also stars, tells the story of a young man named Cole, who is tasked with bringing down the Italian Mob. Cole uses his paintings to send secret messages to the police, which pisses me off, because in grad school I wrote a short story with basically that exact idea. And I failed the grad-school class, but Mr. Kern is getting early Oscar buzz. Justice? Not in this life. Before the film started, the studio girl who set up the screening smiled at me and thanked me for coming. She told me her name, but I wasn’t paying attention, because I was trying to work out whether sleeping with her would be a conflict of interest. I think her name started with an “R,” though. Rebecca? Rachel? Or it could have been something weird. Reba? Are people still named Reba? In the movie, Cole, a happily married father of two, is an abstract painter, which raises the question: How can he afford a brownstone in the West Village? I’ve been writing movie reviews for a blog that attracts more than eight hundred and forty-five unique views a month, and I live in the kind of housing complex that rappers brag about escaping. Cole’s wife is played by the supermodel turned actress Stephanie Anderson, who looks kind of like Jenny Kramer, a girl who was nice to me in middle school, and whom I probably could have dated if she hadn’t transferred high schools. I wonder what Jenny’s doing right now. She’s probably wondering what I’m doing. Funny. Anyway, Cole witnesses a murder and is pursued by members of the Mafia, who start buying his art. I couldn’t figure out if they were buying his paintings to see if they somehow revealed who the murderer was, or if they were buying his paintings to get close to him, so that they could kill him. This confusion could have been the fault of Kern’s screenplay, or it could have issued from my sneaking out of the screening room to pee during an important scene. When I got back from the bathroom, I asked the critic next to me (from the Times) why the Mob was pursuing Cole, and he whispered that it was the same reason “the French colonel pursued normalcy in Buñuel’s ‘The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.’ ” No help there. Pretentious jerk. I thought about asking Reba, or Raquel, but I didn’t want her to think that I hadn’t been paying attention. And the Times critic seemed to love the movie, which is no surprise, because the Times loves everything. Well, everything except me. I went in for an interview three years ago, with a résumé and a packet of my reviews, and they rejected me. But the joke’s on them, because I cancelled my subscription, and now I use my friend’s password to break through their paywall. The standout performance was by Peter Jaworski, who played the Mob boss’s son, Sonny. Sonny is a ladies’ man, even though Jaworski is at least two or three inches shorter than I am. Kudos to you, Mr. Kern, for your casting choice. If a shrimp like Jaworski can sleep with Stephanie Anderson, then I could certainly date a little studio intern like Ramona. Or was it Rosalind? After the screening, I approached the studio girl and said, “Hey there, Rhonda, how about you and I make some abstract art of our own?” She gave me a look that simultaneously said, “You’re a disgusting person” and “My name is not Rhonda, or anything remotely similar to Rhonda.” And, with that, my already bad day was ruined. In sum, these are the main problems with “Paintings of Cole”: it was inconveniently shown on the Upper West Side, written by a guy I envy, screened by a cute intern whose name was too confusing to remember, based on an idea that I poorly executed in grad school, and praised by the Times, which rejected me. Nonetheless, “Paintings of Cole” is easily the best movie of the year. I’m saying this only in the hope that the studio might print my name after a blurb on the movie poster. And I’ve always wanted to have my name on a movie poster. How cool would that be? Like, back in New Jersey, Jenny Kramer will be at her local multiplex, and she’ll see my name on the poster for “Paintings of Cole” and be, like, “His opinion is on a movie poster! I should call him and ask for his opinion about sleeping with me.” Then we actually would sleep together. And she would give me a great review. ♦ Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter: the best of The New Yorker every day. E-mail address GO SIGN UP"),
    ("world", "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story BRUSSELS — As the French authorities continued DNA tests to determine whether the Belgian man suspected of organizing the Paris terrorist attacks was killed in a raid, the Belgian police conducted their own sweep in Brussels on Thursday. Seven raids are being conducted in Brussels in relation to Bilal Hadfi, one of the dead Paris attackers, a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor said, adding that the houses of Mr. Hadfi’s friends and relatives were being searched. One person has been detained for questioning. The latest search for suspects came as the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said an attack using “chemical or biological weapons” in France could not be ruled out, and the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, asked Parliament to approve a variety of strict new security measures. Separately, the White House said President Obama would not abandon plans to attend climate change talks in Paris at the end of the month despite security concerns in the city. The Paris prefecture has extended a ban on protests in the Paris area until Sunday. At least some of the Belgian raids were being conducted in Molenbeek, the Brussels district that has emerged as a crucial link in the investigation of the attacks in Paris on Friday that left at least 129 people dead. Molenbeek was the base for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Belgian who is believed to have organized the attacks, and two Abdeslam brothers: Salah, who is still at large, and Ibrahim, who died after he detonated a suicide bomb at a cafe on Friday. Mr. Abaaoud was the focus of a raid on Wednesday in St.-Denis, a suburb on the northern edge of Paris, that ended with eight people in custody. On Wednesday, the French prosecutor, François Molins, said only that Mr. Abaaoud was not taken into custody. The authorities were conducting tests on the remains of at least two bodies that were found after the raid, in which a suicide bomber died after she detonated an explosive vest. Mr. Valls, in a speech at the French National Assembly, where lawmakers were debating a three-month extension of a state of emergency, warned that “we must not rule anything out” when considering the possibility that terrorists might use chemical weapons. Mr. Valls also called for reinforced tracking of movements of people within the European Union and urged European countries to improve the sharing of airline passenger information. “France has been attacked,” Mr. Valls said in justifying the need to extend the state of emergency. “French people are under shock. They are expecting from all of us some strong, quick and effective reactions.” Among some long-term measures, Mr. Valls announced the creation of a “structure for radicalized youths” that would accommodate those who have abandoned extremist views. Admission to the program would be contingent on a judicial review, Mr. Valls said, and jihadists returning from Iraq or Syria would not be allowed. “Their place is in prison,” he said. On Wednesday, President François Hollande announced at a gathering of French mayors that local police forces that requested them would be provided with weapons and bulletproof jackets, taken from the stocks of the national police.

The three-month period would begin on Nov. 26th; France’s upper house of Parliament, the Senate, will consider the extension and vote on Friday. In Belgium, Mr. Michel announced new security measures intended to strengthen the fight again terrorism, and called for closer international cooperation to combat terrorism and the Islamic State by strengthening Europe’s external borders and by working together at the United Nations. He asked Parliament to double the budget for state security in fighting terrorism, adding 400 million euros, or about $427 million, and to extend the maximum detention time without charges in suspected terrorism cases to 72 hours from 24 hours. He also called on lawmakers to give the government the authority to shut down mosques that preach hate speech. The government also said it would increase recruitment for security forces, and would invest in new technology and better communication systems. It will also extend the use of investigative methods for terrorism cases, like wiretapping and raids on private homes, to other crimes, in particular arms trafficking, a new priority. If Parliament passes the measures, Belgians who travel abroad to fight with the Islamic State would be imprisoned upon their return, and people believed to be at risk of going overseas to wage jihad would be given an electronic bracelet and could be stripped of their Belgian citizenship, a measure that France is also considering. Other Belgian measures would shut down websites that propagate hate speech and would introduce routine identity controls for passengers boarding planes and high-speed trains. Also, for the first time, the authorities would be allowed to conduct raids on at night in terrorism cases; currently, raids are not allowed between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. The measures follow a package proposed in January, one day after a raid in Verviers, Belgium, that killed two men suspected of belonging to a terrorist cell run by Mr. Abaaoud. In Manila, Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said Mr. Obama would attend the beginning of the climate conference, on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, along with many other world leaders. “We are planning for him to go to Paris,” Mr. Rhodes said. “We have great confidence in our French partners.” Mr. Rhodes said the United States had been coordinating with the French authorities on intelligence since the Paris attacks, though he said the French would make the ultimate decisions on security for world leaders at the climate talks."),
