s = "Photo Before we get into today’s puzzle, we have a special note from Will Shortz: Every fall since 2008, The Times has had a special crossword week of some sort. In 2008, it was “Teen Puzzlemaker Week,” in which all the puzzles were constructed by young contributors. In 2009, there was “Half-Century Puzzlemakers,” with only constructors who’d been making Times crosswords for 50+ years. Members of the Brown University crossword club made all the puzzles for a week in 2010. There were weeklong contests by Patrick Berry and Patrick Blindauer in 2011 and 2014, and Sunday contests by Caleb Rasmussen and Mike Selinker in 2012 and 2013. Next week we’re doing something new — literally. We’re calling it “New Ideas Week.” Joel and I asked some favorite Times constructors, what would you like to do in a daily Times crossword that has never been done before? The results will appear Monday through Saturday. I should say upfront that the term “new” is relative. Some of next week’s ideas are more out there than others. But all the puzzles have twists. Fasten your seat belts. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FRIDAY PUZZLE — We interrupt this crossword blog for breaking news from our reporter, David Steinberg, who is currently embedded at Stanford University: “I constructed this puzzle in March 2014, during my junior year of high school. Wait a second, what’s high school? Oh yeah, that’s so last year! “Now that Stanford has started up, everything else has faded into a blur. Even though I’ve only had a week of classes, I can see that college is going to be much more time- and homework-intensive than high school was! I’m not sure how all my crossword activities are going to fit in with college, but I’ll definitely make time to submit puzzles every once in a while.” One can only hope that, as mentioned in previous posts, Mr. Steinberg finds himself some sort of companionship soon. He continues: “My seed entries for this puzzle were PLAYBOY MANSION and TOPLESS DANCERS, which seems kind of weird now that there are girls living in close proximity . . . oh well, YOLO! I still think this symmetrical pair [Please stop. — D.A.] is pretty awesome, even though I’m obviously much more mature now that I’m in college.” [Of course you are. Everyone knows that the college years are when all mature and responsible activities take place. — D.A.] Mr. Steinberg would also like us to know that his scholarly pursuits have not stopped him from taking up the righteous causes of his generation. The struggle is real, people. “And I was especially thrilled to be able to incorporate two of my nine-letter seed entries, AIR HOCKEY and GENIUS BAR, in the neighboring stacks. Speaking of AIR HOCKEY, my dorm doesn’t have it for some reason, which is really frustrating! We have ping-pong and pool tables, but I personally prefer air hockey to both of these. Well, I guess I’ll have to appeal to dorm gov at some point — alas, the struggle of being a college student!” Nonetheless, Mr. Steinberg has not lost his eye for tearing back unsatisfactory fill and duplicates and trying to balance what he refers to as a “meh” fill (SAR) with … hey, are you guys going to a party? Wait for me! “Anyway, my other favorite entries were HIPHOP, METH LABS, HELLION, OOH-LA-LA and BITCOIN. I wasn’t thrilled with LASER PEN (which doesn’t sound as good to my ear as LASER POINTER), EDH or RATA (mainly because of its position as the first across entry), but these three entries seemed like smallish tradeoffs, and I was certainly satisfied enough to proceed to the cluing. Well, not quite! Before I clue a puzzle, I always check to make sure there aren’t any dupes, which is a nerve-wracking process. My heart sunk when I noticed BAR at 35-Across, which was much too similar to GENIUS BAR. Fortunately, I noticed that the letter at 35-Across/29-Down could also be an S. SAR is kinda meh, but at least I was able to spice up the OSAMA clue. “Well, that’s about all I have to say. Time to get back to tearing it up at frat parties . . . er, I mean getting ahead on my computer science and math assignments due next week! In any case, happy solving!” I’m totally telling Mom on you. Oh, what the heck. Everyone put on your weekend togas and shout! Your thoughts?"
