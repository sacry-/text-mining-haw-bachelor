I arrived in the middle of a fierce melee. Unmasked people were running straight up to the police lines, brazenly pitching bricks from as little as 10 feet away. Clouds of teargas filled the air.

Within a few minutes, the intersection cleared, and the riot squad stood at bay. A few television cameras remained, and I joined them to try to snap some photos of the police line. An officer from behind the line came up to me and told me that I needed to move. I reached in my jacket to show my press pass, and asked the armor-clad giant which way I should go. He started to say, &#8220; I don&#8217;t know, but you can&#8217;t stay here &#8230;&#8221; and was interrupted by a captain barking: &#8220;Him!

Photograph: Shawn Carri&#233;\n\n\n\n<p>Hours passed by with no marker other than the irregular flow of prisoners called to be given their charge papers. Most were handed charges of rioting, burglary, arson or disorderly conduct. Two 19-year-old brothers in my cell were charged with disorderly conduct and slapped with a $150,000 bail citing a long description of a group of three to 10 black males running. One of them said that he had thought about joining in the looting of a clothing store, but decided against it and went home. The document didn&#8217;t cite any stolen property on their persons when police arrested them a block away from their house.</p>\n<p>My name was never called to be given charges. The two men who were with me for the duration of my stay also never received charges. Orion [name changed] was a 30-year-old with a wife and daughter, who told me he didn&#8217;t even know there was a riot going on. He told me he just stood still with his hands up as a riot squad ran past him, then came back a minute later and told him he was behind their lines and arrested him.</p>\n<p>Maintaining his innocence, he was anxious the entire two days I spent with him, worrying that a new charge would violate his probation for a gun possession charge three years ago. </p>\n<p>Quite a few of the inmates spoke about Freddie Gray, the mundanity of police brutality, and friends or family abused by police. &#8220;Enough is enough&#8221; was a common sentiment behind the outburst of repressed anger.</p>\n<p>Most did not possess the eloquence of Dr King when he described riots as &#8220;the language of the unheard&#8221;. Dante [name changed] was rowdy, invariably screaming a story at full bellow, or banging on the iron door for a CO&#8217;s attention to speak to a lawyer. He had been arrested for violating the curfew on Tuesday night, but spoke proudly about the thrill of getting away with a pair of new sneakers on Monday. </p>\n<p>He and many others reminisced excitedly about the riots as if it were the morning after a raging party. They saw the riots as a chance to &#8220;come up&#8221; and get some free loot which could be sold on the black market. But as the bacchanalia faded into the heaviness of prison, the hangover hung deep in one man&#8217;s regretful sigh: &#8220;Damn, I should&#8217;ve never gone into that liquor store.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/us-news/2015/may/02/my-49-hours-in-a-baltimore-cell-for-being-a-reporter#img-3\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430502058702/f5007d59-00fe-4c36-a124-42a0ab948945-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Baltimore riot\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483da%2Fsfb%23img-3&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=My+49+hours+in+a+Baltimore+cell+%E2%80%93+for+being+a+reporter&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483da%2Fstw%23img-3\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=My+49+hours+in+a+Baltimore+cell+%E2%80%93+for+being+a+reporter&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2015%2Fmay%2F02%2Fmy-49-hours-in-a-baltimore-cell-for-being-a-reporter&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F1%2F1430502059284%2F4996929d-3bb0-40da-907e-e4f582ca3efd-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nThe Baltimore riot.
