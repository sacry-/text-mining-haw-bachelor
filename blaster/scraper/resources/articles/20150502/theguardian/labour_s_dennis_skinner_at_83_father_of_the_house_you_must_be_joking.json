I don&#8217;t trust the papers.&#8221; I protest my innocence. &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s the fact that you&#8217;re standing again, and if you complete another five years, you&#8217;ll have been in parliament for half a century. Oh, and the paperback of your memoir is about to come out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; he says &#8220;Nobody tells me anything.&#8221; Eventually he relents. &#8220;All right. You&#8217;d better come tomorrow. The weather looks better than the day after. If it&#8217;s raining, we&#8217;ll just be talking to people through their windows. Bolsover library at 12 o&#8217;clock. We can talk there and then go out campaigning. I just hope it isn&#8217;t raining. It was terrible today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I expect Bolsover, in north-east Derbyshire, to be a tough little industrial town, but it&#8217;s actually more a large, sleepy village. Skinner&#8217;s constituency, which he has represented for Labour since 1970, is a collection of 20-odd former pit villages strung across 30 miles of rural Derbyshire. This is now a green and pleasant land, gentrifying in parts. Neighbouring seats, undergoing similar transformations, are no longer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\" class=\" u-underline\">Labour</a> bankers, but Skinner&#8217;s still is. His election agent, Gary Ransford, expects the 11,000 majority at the last election to rise to 15,000-plus at this one.</p>\n<p>Skinner is waiting for me in the little library when I arrive, and we talk at a small table in the fiction section. At 83 &#8211; and having survived a heart bypass and bladder cancer in the past decade &#8211; he is in remarkably good nick. He has carefully groomed, shoulder-length grey hair, a rheumy right eye that weeps later when he stands speechifying in the cold wind, and sports a natty jacket and red tie. He is, you sense, a man who cares about his appearance.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/politics/2015/may/02/labour-mp-dennis-skinner-at-83-interview#img-1\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430497848903/0b8dafd1-ddf6-49b5-95ea-12d9df57e155-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Dennis Skinner earlier in his career\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483t7%2Fsfb%23img-1&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Labour%E2%80%99s+Dennis+Skinner+at+83%3A+%E2%80%98Father+of+the+House%3F+You+must+be+joking%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483t7%2Fstw%23img-1\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Labour%E2%80%99s+Dennis+Skinner+at+83%3A+%E2%80%98Father+of+the+House%3F+You+must+be+joking%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2015%2Fmay%2F02%2Flabour-mp-dennis-skinner-at-83-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F1%2F1430497849498%2F0b8dafd1-ddf6-49b5-95ea-12d9df57e155-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\n&#8216;I&#8217;ve been very lucky&#8217; &#8230; Skinner earlier in his career.

He&#8217;ll be close to 90 if the next parliament runs its course &#8211; only Gerald Kaufman, standing again for Labour in Manchester Gorton at 84, is older. &#8220;Mainly because Cameron told me to retire,&#8221; Skinner says. &#8220;People seem to forget.

I was playing tennis way into my 50s, until my knees began to give me trouble, and I still ride a bike, although my last one was stolen from the House of Commons.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Everyone is shaped by their upbringing, but Skinner is defined by his. His memoir, Sailing Close to the Wind, recounts growing up as one of nine children in a poor but loving mining family in Clay Cross, a few miles south of Chesterfield. Bright and articulate, he passed the 11-plus and went to a grammar school, but rather than try for university, chose to leave school at 16 and follow his father down the pit. When he started work at Parkhouse colliery, one of 10 mines close to Clay Cross, there were 700,000 miners in the UK &#8211; the vanguard of the Labour movement.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/politics/2015/may/02/labour-mp-dennis-skinner-at-83-interview#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430499194720/40c2904a-4b13-487d-ab14-b36699d4fbd1-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Skinner with Tony Benn at the Blackpool Labour conference in 1982.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483t7%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Labour%E2%80%99s+Dennis+Skinner+at+83%3A+%E2%80%98Father+of+the+House%3F+You+must+be+joking%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483t7%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Labour%E2%80%99s+Dennis+Skinner+at+83%3A+%E2%80%98Father+of+the+House%3F+You+must+be+joking%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2015%2Fmay%2F02%2Flabour-mp-dennis-skinner-at-83-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F1%2F1430499195241%2F40c2904a-4b13-487d-ab14-b36699d4fbd1-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nSkinner with Tony Benn (left) at the Blackpool Labour conference in 1982. Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex Shutterstock\n\n\n\n<p>Politics were in his blood &#8211; his father had been blacklisted after the general strike of 1926 &#8211; and in the 1960s he was a member of Clay Cross district council, a leftwing citadel that later fought a famous battle against the Heath government&#8217;s decision to raise rents for council tenants. He was also president of the National Union of Mineworkers in Derbyshire in the mid-60s, before being pressed to be Labour candidate for Bolsover, a role he claims he never sought.</p>\n<p>He made a series of vows &#8211; no junkets, no drinking in the Commons bars, no pairing with Tories &#8211; and is still clinging to them 45 years later. He says that&#8217;s why his majority has remained rock solid while others have dwindled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve survived because I had a set of principles and took decisions about expenses 20 years before the trouble came out in the press.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His father told him to &#8220;treat parliament as a workplace and to keep my eyes on what the others were up to&#8221;, and he has always seen being an MP as an ordinary job, just like working in the pit. That&#8217;s one reason he likes to get to the House early. &#8220;When you&#8217;re a miner, you have seven yards [of coal seam] to cut, so you&#8217;d get five yards under your belt, then have your snap knowing there were only two left.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Skinner is the embodiment of the &#8220;them and us&#8221; politics of the 1960s and 70s, but does that still play in our fragmented world? &#8220;Of course it does,&#8221; he says. &#8220;When I talk about getting rid of the bedroom tax, I tell people about Buckingham Palace. It&#8217;s got 60 spare rooms, but they haven&#8217;t got a spare room subsidy, as Mr Cameron calls it. Why not? That was a nasty piece of work, the bedroom tax, and I tell people how we&#8217;re going to get rid of it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/politics/2015/may/02/labour-mp-dennis-skinner-at-83-interview#img-3\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430497977791/91eebb42-ffc0-4873-9df8-5faa1be6aee5-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Dennis Skinner campaigning in Bolsover, Derbyshire.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483t7%2Fsfb%23img-3&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Labour%E2%80%99s+Dennis+Skinner+at+83%3A+%E2%80%98Father+of+the+House%3F+You+must+be+joking%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483t7%2Fstw%23img-3\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Labour%E2%80%99s+Dennis+Skinner+at+83%3A+%E2%80%98Father+of+the+House%3F+You+must+be+joking%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2015%2Fmay%2F02%2Flabour-mp-dennis-skinner-at-83-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F1%2F1430497978332%2F91eebb42-ffc0-4873-9df8-5faa1be6aee5-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nSkinner campaigning in Bolsover, Derbyshire. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>The bedroom tax is one of the key themes in the stump speech I hear Skinner make half a dozen times later. Bedroom tax bad; mansion tax &#8211; &#8220;which will be paid by millionaires down south&#8221; &#8211; good. That, plus an attack on the zero-hours contracts at Sports Direct&#8217;s nearby warehouse, is the thrust of his brief, powerful appeals, delivered through loudspeakers attached to Ransford&#8217;s car.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s old-style politics in the raw. &#8220;He&#8217;s done all the same streets as he did in 1979,&#8221; says Ransford, who has been alongside Skinner in every campaign since, and been his agent since 1992. &#8220;It&#8217;s bananas that keep him going,&#8221; says Tom Speed, a flat-capped volunteer with a walking stick who is handing out posters. &#8220;This is how we used to do it. Then TV came along, and they thought, &#8216;Lets leave it to David Dimbleby&#8217;,&#8221; says Skinner. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had less than a 10,000 majority, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s because we do this.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p> Related: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/04/dennis-skinner-lesson-for-labour\" class=\" u-underline\">Dennis Skinner is no model, yet he&amp;nbsp;has a lesson for Labour | Polly Toynbee</a> </p>\n\n<p>Is Ed red enough? &#8220;No&#8221;, he says. &#8220;He goes part of the way, but I&#8217;d go further. I would take rail back [into public ownership]. The parliamentary Labour party has never been a leftwing party.&#8221; Has it been frustrating to spend a lifetime standing up for lost causes? &#8220;Life&#8217;s like that. You have battles to fight. I never had the idea that somehow or other I was going to get to the end of the rainbow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>David Cameron called him a dinosaur, but he doesn&#8217;t care. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never bothered about what people say about me. I understand why they do it, because sometimes they haven&#8217;t got an answer.&#8221; Skinner is not slow to dish out abuse of his own. He called Tory minister John Gummer &#8220;the wart on Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s nose&#8221;, liked to refer to Paddy Ashdown as &#8220;Paddy Pantsdown&#8221;, and in 1984 was expelled from the House (an occupational hazard for Skinner) for calling David Owen a &#8220;pompous sod&#8221;. At each state opening of parliament he punctures the flummery with a well-chosen <a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/queen-attends-st-pauls-ahead-of-procession-55712/view/25836\" class=\" u-underline\">greeting for Black Rod</a>. &#8220;Ayup, here comes <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=puss+in+boots&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=yDUnoibYf5e32M%253A%253BYO_jel693IgAoM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fen.wikipedia.org%25252Fwiki%25252FPuss_in_Boots&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=yDUnoibYf5e32M%253A%252CYO_jel693IgAoM%252C_&amp;usg=__3c63pYxBajsqLwC2nIPiyPAZBss%3D&amp;biw=1482&amp;bih=948&amp;ved=0CJEBEMo3&amp;ei=hp9DVdreONCX7QbmrYHoDw#imgrc=yDUnoibYf5e32M%253A%3BYO_jel693IgAoM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fen%252F7%252F74%252FPussboots.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FPuss_in_Boots%3B648%3B629\" class=\" u-underline\">Puss in Boots,</a>&#8221; he said in 1988, starting a tradition.

What&#8217;s the point of that?&#8217;&#8221; But you would have had the chance to change things, I say. &#8220;You change yourself,&#8221; he replies. &#8220;It&#8217;s patronage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Skinner, assuming he is re-elected, will be one of four MPs &#8211; assuming the other three veterans, Kaufman, Michael Meacher and Ken Clarke, also hold their seats &#8211; to have been in the Commons since 1970. Kaufman would become Father of the House, by virtue of having been the first of the four to have been sworn in, and that suits Skinner just fine. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take Father of the House even if I was offered it,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The idea that the Speaker is going to say to me [affects plummy voice]: &#8216;And now I call the Father of the House&#8217; &#8211; you must be joking. I made it clear long ago that I wouldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even many of his enemies now call Skinner a &#8220;national treasure&#8221;, but he refuses to be neutered. When I join him and a group of supporters for a cup of tea at former councillor Eileen Goucher&#8217;s house, I can understand the appeal of this tight-knit community. He is &#8220;Den&#8221; to everyone, old triumphs are relived &#8211; &#8220;Me and Eileen have never been defeated in an election&#8221;, he says &#8211; and on the living-room wall is a painting lionising local mine workers.</p>\n<p>There is a magnificent relentlessness to Skinner. I am exhausted by the end of the day, while he charges on. It has been a privilege to observe him in action, and he is kind enough to drive me back to Chesterfield once the last constituent&#8217;s hand has been shaken. But I have mixed feelings by the end. What&#8217;s it all for? He says the fact he hasn&#8217;t changed after 45 years is his greatest strength. I wonder if it might be his greatest weakness.</p>\n<p>Sailing Close to the Wind is published in paperback by Quercus on 14 May (&#163;9.99).

I was playing tennis way into my 50s, until my knees began to give me trouble, and I still ride a bike, although my last one was stolen from the House of Commons.\u201d\n\nEveryone is shaped by their upbringing, but Skinner is defined by his. His memoir, Sailing Close to the Wind, recounts growing up as one of nine children in a poor but loving mining family in Clay Cross, a few miles south of Chesterfield. Bright and articulate, he passed the 11-plus and went to a grammar school, but rather than try for university, chose to leave school at 16 and follow his father down the pit. When he started work at Parkhouse colliery, one of 10 mines close to Clay Cross, there were 700,000 miners in the UK \u2013 the vanguard of the Labour movement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Skinner with Tony Benn (left) at the Blackpool Labour conference in 1982. Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex Shutterstock\n\nPolitics were in his blood \u2013 his father had been blacklisted after the general strike of 1926 \u2013 and in the 1960s he was a member of Clay Cross district council, a leftwing citadel that later fought a famous battle against the Heath government\u2019s decision to raise rents for council tenants. He was also president of the National Union of Mineworkers in Derbyshire in the mid-60s, before being pressed to be Labour candidate for Bolsover, a role he claims he never sought.\n\nHe made a series of vows \u2013 no junkets, no drinking in the Commons bars, no pairing with Tories \u2013 and is still clinging to them 45 years later. He says that\u2019s why his majority has remained rock solid while others have dwindled. \u201cI\u2019ve survived because I had a set of principles and took decisions about expenses 20 years before the trouble came out in the press.\u201d\n\nHis father told him to \u201ctreat parliament as a workplace and to keep my eyes on what the others were up to\u201d, and he has always seen being an MP as an ordinary job, just like working in the pit. That\u2019s one reason he likes to get to the House early. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a miner, you have seven yards [of coal seam] to cut, so you\u2019d get five yards under your belt, then have your snap knowing there were only two left.\u201d\n\nSkinner is the embodiment of the \u201cthem and us\u201d politics of the 1960s and 70s, but does that still play in our fragmented world? \u201cOf course it does,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I talk about getting rid of the bedroom tax, I tell people about Buckingham Palace. It\u2019s got 60 spare rooms, but they haven\u2019t got a spare room subsidy, as Mr Cameron calls it. Why not? That was a nasty piece of work, the bedroom tax, and I tell people how we\u2019re going to get rid of it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Skinner campaigning in Bolsover, Derbyshire. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian\n\nThe bedroom tax is one of the key themes in the stump speech I hear Skinner make half a dozen times later. Bedroom tax bad; mansion tax \u2013 \u201cwhich will be paid by millionaires down south\u201d \u2013 good. That, plus an attack on the zero-hours contracts at Sports Direct\u2019s nearby warehouse, is the thrust of his brief, powerful appeals, delivered through loudspeakers attached to Ransford\u2019s car.\n\nIt\u2019s old-style politics in the raw. \u201cHe\u2019s done all the same streets as he did in 1979,\u201d says Ransford, who has been alongside Skinner in every campaign since, and been his agent since 1992. \u201cIt\u2019s bananas that keep him going,\u201d says Tom Speed, a flat-capped volunteer with a walking stick who is handing out posters. \u201cThis is how we used to do it. Then TV came along, and they thought, \u2018Lets leave it to David Dimbleby\u2019,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cI\u2019ve never had less than a 10,000 majority, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because we do this.\u201d\n\nRelated: Dennis Skinner is no model, yet he has a lesson for Labour | Polly Toynbee\n\nIs Ed red enough? \u201cNo\u201d, he says. \u201cHe goes part of the way, but I\u2019d go further. I would take rail back [into public ownership]. The parliamentary Labour party has never been a leftwing party.\u201d Has it been frustrating to spend a lifetime standing up for lost causes? \u201cLife\u2019s like that. You have battles to fight. I never had the idea that somehow or other I was going to get to the end of the rainbow.\u201d\n\nDavid Cameron called him a dinosaur, but he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cI\u2019ve never bothered about what people say about me. I understand why they do it, because sometimes they haven\u2019t got an answer.\u201d Skinner is not slow to dish out abuse of his own. He called Tory minister John Gummer \u201cthe wart on Mrs Thatcher\u2019s nose\u201d, liked to refer to Paddy Ashdown as \u201cPaddy Pantsdown\u201d, and in 1984 was expelled from the House (an occupational hazard for Skinner) for calling David Owen a \u201cpompous sod\u201d. At each state opening of parliament he punctures the flummery with a well-chosen greeting for Black Rod. \u201cAyup, here comes Puss in Boots,\u201d he said in 1988, starting a tradition. Skinner, parliament\u2019s great vaudevillian, revels in political knockabout.\n\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video.

What\u2019s the point of that?\u2019\u201d But you would have had the chance to change things, I say. \u201cYou change yourself,\u201d he replies. \u201cIt\u2019s patronage.\u201d\n\nSkinner, assuming he is re-elected, will be one of four MPs \u2013 assuming the other three veterans, Kaufman, Michael Meacher and Ken Clarke, also hold their seats \u2013 to have been in the Commons since 1970. Kaufman would become Father of the House, by virtue of having been the first of the four to have been sworn in, and that suits Skinner just fine. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take Father of the House even if I was offered it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea that the Speaker is going to say to me [affects plummy voice]: \u2018And now I call the Father of the House\u2019 \u2013 you must be joking. I made it clear long ago that I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nEven many of his enemies now call Skinner a \u201cnational treasure\u201d, but he refuses to be neutered. When I join him and a group of supporters for a cup of tea at former councillor Eileen Goucher\u2019s house, I can understand the appeal of this tight-knit community. He is \u201cDen\u201d to everyone, old triumphs are relived \u2013 \u201cMe and Eileen have never been defeated in an election\u201d, he says \u2013 and on the living-room wall is a painting lionising local mine workers.\n\nThere is a magnificent relentlessness to Skinner. I am exhausted by the end of the day, while he charges on. It has been a privilege to observe him in action, and he is kind enough to drive me back to Chesterfield once the last constituent\u2019s hand has been shaken. But I have mixed feelings by the end. What\u2019s it all for? He says the fact he hasn\u2019t changed after 45 years is his greatest strength. I wonder if it might be his greatest weakness.\n\nSailing Close to the Wind is published in paperback by Quercus on 14 May (\u00a39.99). To buy it for \u00a37.99, visit bookshop.theguardian.com",
