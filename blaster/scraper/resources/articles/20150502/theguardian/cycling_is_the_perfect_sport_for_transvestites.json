  "article_html": "<div><p>Mountain biking has been a dusty thread running through my life. It has helped keep me sane and thin enough to fit into 15-year-old dresses. I never feel more alive than when I slip out of the studio late on a sunny weekday afternoon, zip out through north-east London and hit Epping Forest dirt just as rush hour begins behind me. It may not be the Alps or even the Lakes but I enter a world where all that matters is the twisting trail, my burning thighs and riding as fast as possible over bumps.</p>\n<p>A big part of sport for me is the benefit for mental health. Nothing combats feeling depressed or anxious like a good hard workout. Mountain biking takes me out of my studio, out of my head and into my body and the countryside. Haring down a hillside leaves no time to ponder. You live in the moment, you focus on not crashing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's a little-known fact that I invented the mountain bike when I was 14 in 1974</p>\n\nGrayson Perry\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is a little-known fact that I invented the mountain bike when I was 14 in 1974, in the back of a biology exercise book. Like a lot of my mates, I liked to ride my stripped-down road bike fitted with speedway-style handlebars through the Essex woods, over bumps and bomb holes. Riding a bicycle wasn&#8217;t a sport to me then. My stepfather and mother made home a place of brooding violence and frightening hysterical outbursts of shouting and screaming. My bike got me out of the house and away from my dysfunctional family.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/lifeandstyle/2015/may/02/cycling-is-the-perfect-sport-for-transvestites#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/14/1429011509289/1357497e-3c99-4490-9ec7-3b12cffc9b43-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Grayson Perry has been a keen cyclist for more than 40 years.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F47fnp%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%27Cycling+is+the+perfect+sport+for+transvestites%27&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F47fnp%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=%27Cycling+is+the+perfect+sport+for+transvestites%27&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Flifeandstyle%2F2015%2Fmay%2F02%2Fcycling-is-the-perfect-sport-for-transvestites&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F14%2F1429011509895%2F1357497e-3c99-4490-9ec7-3b12cffc9b43-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nGrayson Perry has been a keen cyclist for more than 40 years.
