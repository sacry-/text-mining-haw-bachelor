Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA\n\n\n\n<p>But he insists the campaign&#8217;s whirlwind final days will not just be negative, as Labour puts forward a positive agenda. His aides duly released the 10 bills that have been prioritised by Lord Falconer, the Labour peer charged with preparing for any transition to power.</p>\n<p>The bills would focus on reforms to economic foundations, an energy market and price freeze bill, an NHS Time to Care bill repealing much Tory health legislation, an immigration and labour market exploitation bill, a stronger families bill reforming child care a &#8220;make work pay&#8221; bill involving reforms to the minimum wage, a tuition fees reduction and university finance bill, a reform to land planning and private rented markets, a technical education bill reforming apprenticeships, and an anti-tax avoidance finance bill.</p>\n<p>The list gives a broad sense of priorities, but inevitably little sense of the detail that might make the programme palatable either directly in negotiation with a potential coalition partner such as the Liberal Democrats, or indirectly by persuading the SNP not to vote down a Labour Queen&#8217;s speech.</p>\n<p>Reflections on such compromises will be under way in deep secrecy within Labour, but there is no sign Miliband, one of the least conventional Labour leaders in postwar years, will retreat on his fundamental view on public spending or equality.</p>\n<p>Miliband, for instance, was unrepentant in his belief that Labour did not allow public spending to spiral out of control ahead of the financial crash, even though he was given a mauling from a member of the Question Time audience over the issue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The debt and the deficit were lower at the crash than the ones we inherited. The real issue was that there was an unprecedented global financial crisis. You can take two views: the deficit caused the global financial crisis, or the global financial crisis caused the deficit. The reality is the latter. We should have better bank regulation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the public are not looking for pie-in-the-sky promises &#8230; I think they are in the mood for something quite gritty</p>\n\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#8220;But this argument matters. The Tories want to fight the 2010 election and not the 2015 election. I am going into this election saying we are going to cut spending outside health and education, and the Tories want to prosecute this argument that you can simply cut your way to deficit reduction.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>On meeting Russell Brand</h2>\n<p>&#8220;He approached us, and the reality is that ever since Russell Brand said that thing about not voting, people have said to me &#8216;Russell Brand is an idiot&#8217;. Well, I disagree with him about not voting, but in way there is no point shooting the messenger, because he has been sending a message about how many people view politics.<br></p>\n<p>&#8220;Politics is so broken &#8211; one of the great unaddressed scandals of this election is that there are seven million not registered to vote &#8211; so I could not understand the idea that you do not reach out to someone that has articulated that message and who reaches people that are disengaged from politics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If there were more people like him, I would reach out to them too. I am going to take this anywhere. In a way it is old-politics new-politics, and frankly a bit of old media and new media. Do you go to where people are, or do you say &#8216;Sorry I am stuck in the Westminster game, and if you don&#8217;t want to join our game you can go jump in a lake&#8217;? I find it remarkable in a way that anyone says that is remarkable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think he began the interview saying ever since the suffragettes nothing has really happened, and I said well hang on a minute &#8211; NHS, women&#8217;s rights, minimum wage and gay and lesbian rights.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t simply have a conventional political view about the way change happens. All the lessons of history show it is not just politicians that bring about change. Look at the biggest change in my lifetime: gay and lesbian rights. Tony Blair played a tremendous role in this, but he would say it was the movement that pushed for change. All of the big advances come from this confluence between people and politics. In a country where you have quite conservative institutions, it is this pressure, these movements, that bring about change. I think people want politics to be opened up, and if he endorses me that is fine, but I have got to admit sometimes that change is going to be hard. I think the public are not looking for pie-in-the-sky promises, or euphoria. I think they are in the mood for something quite gritty and realistic.&#8221;</p>\n</div>",

His aides duly released the 10 bills that have been prioritised by Lord Falconer, the Labour peer charged with preparing for any transition to power.\n\nThe bills would focus on reforms to economic foundations, an energy market and price freeze bill, an NHS Time to Care bill repealing much Tory health legislation, an immigration and labour market exploitation bill, a stronger families bill reforming child care a \u201cmake work pay\u201d bill involving reforms to the minimum wage, a tuition fees reduction and university finance bill, a reform to land planning and private rented markets, a technical education bill reforming apprenticeships, and an anti-tax avoidance finance bill.\n\nThe list gives a broad sense of priorities, but inevitably little sense of the detail that might make the programme palatable either directly in negotiation with a potential coalition partner such as the Liberal Democrats, or indirectly by persuading the SNP not to vote down a Labour Queen\u2019s speech.\n\nReflections on such compromises will be under way in deep secrecy within Labour, but there is no sign Miliband, one of the least conventional Labour leaders in postwar years, will retreat on his fundamental view on public spending or equality.\n\nMiliband, for instance, was unrepentant in his belief that Labour did not allow public spending to spiral out of control ahead of the financial crash, even though he was given a mauling from a member of the Question Time audience over the issue.\n\n\u201cThe debt and the deficit were lower at the crash than the ones we inherited. The real issue was that there was an unprecedented global financial crisis. You can take two views: the deficit caused the global financial crisis, or the global financial crisis caused the deficit. The reality is the latter. We should have better bank regulation.\n\nI think the public are not looking for pie-in-the-sky promises \u2026 I think they are in the mood for something quite gritty\n\n\u201cBut this argument matters. The Tories want to fight the 2010 election and not the 2015 election. I am going into this election saying we are going to cut spending outside health and education, and the Tories want to prosecute this argument that you can simply cut your way to deficit reduction.\u201d\n\nOn meeting Russell Brand\n\n\u201cHe approached us, and the reality is that ever since Russell Brand said that thing about not voting, people have said to me \u2018Russell Brand is an idiot\u2019. Well, I disagree with him about not voting, but in way there is no point shooting the messenger, because he has been sending a message about how many people view politics.\n\n\n\n\u201cPolitics is so broken \u2013 one of the great unaddressed scandals of this election is that there are seven million not registered to vote \u2013 so I could not understand the idea that you do not reach out to someone that has articulated that message and who reaches people that are disengaged from politics.\n\n\u201cIf there were more people like him, I would reach out to them too. I am going to take this anywhere. In a way it is old-politics new-politics, and frankly a bit of old media and new media. Do you go to where people are, or do you say \u2018Sorry I am stuck in the Westminster game, and if you don\u2019t want to join our game you can go jump in a lake\u2019? I find it remarkable in a way that anyone says that is remarkable.\n\n\u201cI think he began the interview saying ever since the suffragettes nothing has really happened, and I said well hang on a minute \u2013 NHS, women\u2019s rights, minimum wage and gay and lesbian rights.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t simply have a conventional political view about the way change happens. All the lessons of history show it is not just politicians that bring about change. Look at the biggest change in my lifetime: gay and lesbian rights. Tony Blair played a tremendous role in this, but he would say it was the movement that pushed for change. All of the big advances come from this confluence between people and politics. In a country where you have quite conservative institutions, it is this pressure, these movements, that bring about change. I think people want politics to be opened up, and if he endorses me that is fine, but I have got to admit sometimes that change is going to be hard. I think the public are not looking for pie-in-the-sky promises, or euphoria. I think they are in the mood for something quite gritty and realistic.\u201d",
