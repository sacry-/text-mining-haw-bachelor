  "article_html": "<div><p>Every week for the past year, Neil Robson has made a trip to his local Co-op and spent around &#163;20 on a bag of shopping that he then carries to the <a href=\"http://wandsworth.foodbank.org.uk/\" class=\" u-underline\">Wandsworth food bank</a> in south London. Before he leaves home, he consults a list of the most-wanted items on their website, noting what they&#8217;re running out of (basic toiletries, UHT milk, tinned meat, tinned fish). This week he adds a tin of sustainably-sourced tuna to the bag.</p>\n<p>Robson is a retired human resources manager in his 60s, who has never previously been involved in community charity projects. What drives him to make this regular gesture? &#8220;Anger. How can it be that there should be people so stretched for cash that they can&#8217;t get the money they need for food? I am not a churchgoer; I do this in a secular capacity. My motto, like a Victorian embroidered sampler, is: &#8216;My neighbour must not go hungry.&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Robson has devoted considerable time to researching what might be causing the huge surge in food bank use. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been reading about people who, through no fault of their own, are not getting the money they need. I am affronted &#8211; shocked that in this wonderful country, people are stuck in a situation where they truly don&#8217;t have enough money to eat for the next couple of days.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Food banks have become one of the most potent symbols of the coalition administration and a key theme in the election campaign. In 2010, the food bank was an unfamiliar concept, but five years later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/22/food-bank-users-uk-low-paid-workers-poverty\" class=\" u-underline\">more than 1,000 are operating around the country</a>. The UK&#8217;s largest food bank operator said that in 2014-15, it distributed enough emergency food to give more than a million people three days&#8217; supply. The first issue <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32064712\" class=\" u-underline\">Jeremy Paxman confronted David Cameron with in his televised interview was food banks</a>; Cameron revealed that he did not know how many there were in the UK. The Labour party has said the rise in food bank use is a sign of a failed welfare state, and promised to slash the number of people reliant on them.</p>\n<p>What has caused this dramatic rise? For frontline workers, the explanation is simple: that the reform of the welfare system, austerity, the recession and rising living costs have created a pernicious cocktail where people have found themselves unable to cope, struggling to get assistance from the state, and forced to turn to charities for emergency help. According to the <a href=\"http://www.trusselltrust.org/\" class=\" u-underline\">Trussell Trust</a>, the UK&#8217;s largest network of food banks, with more than 1,000 affiliated food distribution centres, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trusselltrust.org%2Fresources%2Fdocuments%2FPress%2FTrussell-Trust-foodbank-use-tops-one-million.pdf&amp;ei=M5M3VaGxCIefsAG5yoKgBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXKXwkTOmdV06XKnOE-KrNHWk9hg&amp;sig2=gU-IcjxVyUrdMCMeVyNsZg&amp;bvm=bv.91071109,d.bGg\" class=\" u-underline\">about 43% of people who come to them seeking help cite benefit changes or delays as the cause of their difficulties; around 22% say it is simply the result of low income</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am shocked that in this wonderful country, people don&#8217;t have enough money to eat for the next couple of days</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/society/2015/may/01/food-banks-most-people-at-the-school-gates-have-used-them#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430301463591/f4f25a11-452b-4901-abbb-9d80ae512135-311x360.jpeg\" alt=\"Neil Robson\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48vb2%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Food+banks%3A+%27Most+people+at+the+school+gates+have+used+them%27&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48vb2%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Food+banks%3A+%27Most+people+at+the+school+gates+have+used+them%27&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsociety%2F2015%2Fmay%2F01%2Ffood-banks-most-people-at-the-school-gates-have-used-them&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F29%2F1430301462750%2F59225071-e984-4099-b78b-fd87d1cc3d55-881x1020.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nNeil Robson donates a bag of food to his local food bank every week. Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://foodpovertyinquiry.org\" class=\" u-underline\">cross-party report</a> in December pointed to structural issues such as delays to benefit payments and harsher sanctioning policies (cutting payments to those who haven&#8217;t complied with jobcentre rules), combined with low wages and high living costs. More than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/08/900000-claiming-job-seekers-allowance-subjected-benefit-sanctions\" class=\" u-underline\">900,000 jobseeker&#8217;s allowance claimants were subject to sanctioning penalties in 2013/14</a> because of a failure to comply with Department for Work and Pensions rules.</p>\n<p>But politicians on the right have been searching for other plausible explanations. Cameron has occasionally described food banks as a manifestation of the Conservative notion of &#8220;big society&#8221; in action (Ed Miliband remarked, &#8220;I never thought the big society was about feeding hungry children in Britain&#8221;). Chief whip Michael Gove suggested that food bank users were guilty of taking decisions that demonstrated they were &#8220;not best able to manage their finances&#8221;, while the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/08/tory-peer-apologises-poor-hungry-do-not-know-cook\" class=\" u-underline\">Conservative peer, Baroness Anne Jenkin, a member of the all-party inquiry into hunger and food poverty, concluded that &#8220;poor people do not know how to cook&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>Robson is reluctant to see his actions as a demonstration of the big society in action. &#8220;The big society strikes me as a political construct, a tainted venture. It&#8217;s an alternative when the state starts stepping back and the local community steps forward to fill in the space.&#8221; He is annoyed by the number of politicians who have been disparaging about the work of Britain&#8217;s food banks. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/04/food-bank-britain-can-mps-agree-causes-uk-poverty\" class=\" u-underline\">Iain Duncan Smith, work and pensions secretary, has accused the Trussell Trust of publicity-seeking and &#8220;scaremongering&#8221;</a>, describing food bank users as &#8220;often people with dysfunctional lives, people who have been caught in drug addiction and family breakdown&#8221;. Ex-Conservative MP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/edwina-currie\" class=\" u-underline\">Edwina Currie</a> said people who use food banks waste their money on tattoos and dog food.</p>\n<p>As Robson sees it, the work of the food bank &#8220;is in step with the proud tradition we have in this country that philanthropists step forward in times of difficulty. Once we start passing judgment on how other people spend their money and run their lives, we leave the door wide open for them to start criticising us and how we spend our money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t stay when he drops his donation off. &#8220;It&#8217;s not my business to chat to them,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to intrude. I hope that someone who doesn&#8217;t have much in their cupboard can have some food that will be healthy. It is a demonstration that they are not alone. I don&#8217;t want to be patronising, but I want you to feel a bit better about yourself because I bet you are feeling low. That is the emotional message I want to send with my tin of tuna. If I can boost someone&#8217;s morale and show respect for them, then I am happy to do it.&#8221;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am not easily shocked, but a&#160;few cases have been hard to hear.

Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>Robson hands his tin of tuna, along with his other purchases, to Dan Frith, the food bank manager. Frith began working with Wandsworth&#8217;s five newly opened centres last year when he returned from South Africa, where he had been working at a drop-in centre for street children.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was surprised by the food banks when I came back from South Africa,&#8221; Frith says. &#8220;I would like to say I am not easily shocked, but a few cases have been hard to hear. Sometimes there are people coming who say they haven&#8217;t eaten for days. We offer tea and toast &#8211; sometimes we just observe how quickly people eat the toast and how they would not be themselves until they have eaten it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Justin Welby, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/justin-welby\" class=\" u-underline\">archbishop of Canterbury,</a> has said he was more shocked by meeting a hungry family at a food bank in the UK than by the suffering he had seen in African refugee camps, and Frith has wrestled with similar unease. &#8220;You can make comparisons,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The rich and the poor really live on each other&#8217;s doorsteps. That was quite shocking in South Africa, and London is like that, too. It must be linked to the recession, but I think we know that the need has been there for a while: it didn&#8217;t just appear in 2010.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sarah Chapman, who co-founded this food bank and volunteers here every week, helps to sort the donations and puts the tuna in the box of tinned fish and meat. &#8220;I knew there was a need,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Previously, local care professionals were buying food out of their own pockets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She hovers between feeling pleased with the marshalling of community energies to help people and despondency at the rising need. &#8220;We hope that, long term, food banks won&#8217;t be needed. We need to talk about why people come and what we can do to stop them from coming. I would be very uncomfortable if all we did was hand out food, thinking, &#8216;This is nice!&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where are the safety nets when people are bereaved or ill?

Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, 5,017 people were fed by Wandsworth&#8217;s network of food banks; 24% said they needed help because of benefit delay, 19% because of benefit change, 23% because of low incomes. Chapman thinks the need for food banks has been increased by low wages and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/zero-hours-contracts\" class=\" u-underline\">zero&#8209;hours contracts</a>. &#8220;Where are people&#8217;s safety nets when they experience bereavement and illness? People should be paid wages that are high enough that they can afford their own food. But I don&#8217;t see any evidence that we are going in the right direction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The coalition has already cut &#163;20-&#163;25bn from the welfare state, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/19/ifs-challenges-george-osborne-12bn-welfare-spending-cut-plan\" class=\" u-underline\">George Osborne has said he wants to cut another &#163;12bn</a> if he remains chancellor after the election. The national crisis loan system, whereby jobcentres paid out small grants and loans to vulnerable people in crisis situations (averaging around &#163;50), has been devolved to local authorities and claimants have found it much harder to get a loan. At the same time, there has been a shift away from a country where people in need could expect to turn to the state for essential support, and a step towards a new model where charity is embraced as an essential part of the welfare state.</p>\n<p>Emergency support is no longer something neutral and discreet; it often comes in the form of church handouts, which can bring unwelcome complications. Despite the best efforts of the charities, the donated food may not be what individuals need. Some outlets are supplied with supermarket castoffs, non-essential items such as bakewell tarts that haven&#8217;t sold, unusual flavours of yoghurt (lemon and coconut) that no one wants to buy. It&#8217;s not always fresh or a reliable source of sustenance. Oxfam has reported that some recipients are forced to return packages of rice, spaghetti and soup since, with no money, they are unable to pay for electricity to cook the food.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We should be deeply distressed that we are a country that has tolerated inequality for so long, and pleased that local people in local communities care deeply about their neighbours,&#8221; says Chris Mould, chairman of the Trussell Trust. &#8220;A lot of the people we have helped need not have been in the trouble they were in. Improved public services, better social security performance, would have helped prevent tens of thousands of people from getting into trouble.&#8221;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of people are embarrassed or sad.

She volunteers here when she isn&#8217;t working, because she knows what it&#8217;s like to need help from a food bank; four years ago, she was on the receiving end. &#8220;I felt humiliated, I suppose. That&#8217;s maybe why I wanted to volunteer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was in a lot of debt. I got a couple of bags of food. When they come in here, a lot of them are embarrassed or sad.

People stand taller when they leave.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although the Trussell Trust is a Christian body, over the past four years food bank volunteers have emerged in all communities. Jagraj Singh volunteers at <a href=\"http://www.sgsss.org/\" class=\" u-underline\">Sri Guru Singh Sabha</a> Sikh temple in Southall, west London, which feeds up to 10,000 people weekly; anyone is welcome. Although numbers are not formally monitored, he has seen a sharp increase in non-Sikh visitors. &#8220;We are seeing more people who are down on their luck, who have become homeless,&#8221; he says. Aware of the rising demand, volunteers are taking the Sikh practice of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langar_%28Sikhism%29\" class=\" u-underline\">langar</a> (offering a free communal meal) on to the streets of Southall and other parts of Britain.</p>\n<p>Synagogues and mosques have also started offering more food parcels. &#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t just be waiting for these people to come to us,&#8221; Singh says. &#8220;We should be going to them. We&#8217;re feeding between 200 and 400 twice a week in Southall.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chaunte Campbell, 23, takes home the tin of tuna donated by Robson, with a bag of provisions that also contains spaghetti bolognese, a jar of hot chocolate powder, some meatball sauce, soup, hot dogs, noodles, Aunt Bessie&#8217;s dumpling mix, rice, longlife milk, Weetos, kitchen roll, toilet roll and apple juice.</p>\n<p>She plans to make tuna bake for her five-year-old son that evening. &#8220;Tuna is expensive,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but fish is good for you; I like to try him on different types of food. I boil the pasta. When it&#8217;s nearly done, I put it into the glass dish, put cheese on it, mix in the tuna.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is the fourth time she has been to the food bank this year. &#8220;The first time was when my son turned five and my benefit changed from income support to jobseeker&#8217;s allowance.

The council tax payments stopped, the housing benefit was stopped, because of this change in circumstances. Days turned into weeks without it being resolved. I was really worried. I was thinking, &#8216;I have no money, I have a small child, I don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8217; I tried not to show him that mummy is going through problems. I didn&#8217;t want him to think that something was wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This time, her benefits have been reduced for two months, because she applied for only five jobs in a fortnight, when her agreement with the jobcentre stipulates that she should apply for six.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That was all I was able to do. I wouldn&#8217;t apply for a job I know I couldn&#8217;t do. There were jobs out of London &#8211; I knew I couldn&#8217;t pick my son up and take him to school.

  "text": "Every week for the past year, Neil Robson has made a trip to his local Co-op and spent around \u00a320 on a bag of shopping that he then carries to the Wandsworth food bank in south London. Before he leaves home, he consults a list of the most-wanted items on their website, noting what they\u2019re running out of (basic toiletries, UHT milk, tinned meat, tinned fish). This week he adds a tin of sustainably-sourced tuna to the bag.\n\nRobson is a retired human resources manager in his 60s, who has never previously been involved in community charity projects. What drives him to make this regular gesture? \u201cAnger. How can it be that there should be people so stretched for cash that they can\u2019t get the money they need for food? I am not a churchgoer; I do this in a secular capacity. My motto, like a Victorian embroidered sampler, is: \u2018My neighbour must not go hungry.\u2019\u201d\n\nRobson has devoted considerable time to researching what might be causing the huge surge in food bank use. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading about people who, through no fault of their own, are not getting the money they need. I am affronted \u2013 shocked that in this wonderful country, people are stuck in a situation where they truly don\u2019t have enough money to eat for the next couple of days.\u201d\n\nFood banks have become one of the most potent symbols of the coalition administration and a key theme in the election campaign. In 2010, the food bank was an unfamiliar concept, but five years later, more than 1,000 are operating around the country. The UK\u2019s largest food bank operator said that in 2014-15, it distributed enough emergency food to give more than a million people three days\u2019 supply. The first issue Jeremy Paxman confronted David Cameron with in his televised interview was food banks; Cameron revealed that he did not know how many there were in the UK. The Labour party has said the rise in food bank use is a sign of a failed welfare state, and promised to slash the number of people reliant on them.\n\nWhat has caused this dramatic rise? For frontline workers, the explanation is simple: that the reform of the welfare system, austerity, the recession and rising living costs have created a pernicious cocktail where people have found themselves unable to cope, struggling to get assistance from the state, and forced to turn to charities for emergency help. According to the Trussell Trust, the UK\u2019s largest network of food banks, with more than 1,000 affiliated food distribution centres, about 43% of people who come to them seeking help cite benefit changes or delays as the cause of their difficulties; around 22% say it is simply the result of low income.\n\nI am shocked that in this wonderful country, people don\u2019t have enough money to eat for the next couple of days\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Neil Robson donates a bag of food to his local food bank every week. Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian\n\nA cross-party report in December pointed to structural issues such as delays to benefit payments and harsher sanctioning policies (cutting payments to those who haven\u2019t complied with jobcentre rules), combined with low wages and high living costs. More than 900,000 jobseeker\u2019s allowance claimants were subject to sanctioning penalties in 2013/14 because of a failure to comply with Department for Work and Pensions rules.\n\nBut politicians on the right have been searching for other plausible explanations. Cameron has occasionally described food banks as a manifestation of the Conservative notion of \u201cbig society\u201d in action (Ed Miliband remarked, \u201cI never thought the big society was about feeding hungry children in Britain\u201d). Chief whip Michael Gove suggested that food bank users were guilty of taking decisions that demonstrated they were \u201cnot best able to manage their finances\u201d, while the Conservative peer, Baroness Anne Jenkin, a member of the all-party inquiry into hunger and food poverty, concluded that \u201cpoor people do not know how to cook\u201d.\n\nRobson is reluctant to see his actions as a demonstration of the big society in action. \u201cThe big society strikes me as a political construct, a tainted venture. It\u2019s an alternative when the state starts stepping back and the local community steps forward to fill in the space.\u201d He is annoyed by the number of politicians who have been disparaging about the work of Britain\u2019s food banks. Iain Duncan Smith, work and pensions secretary, has accused the Trussell Trust of publicity-seeking and \u201cscaremongering\u201d, describing food bank users as \u201coften people with dysfunctional lives, people who have been caught in drug addiction and family breakdown\u201d. Ex-Conservative MP Edwina Currie said people who use food banks waste their money on tattoos and dog food.\n\nAs Robson sees it, the work of the food bank \u201cis in step with the proud tradition we have in this country that philanthropists step forward in times of difficulty. Once we start passing judgment on how other people spend their money and run their lives, we leave the door wide open for them to start criticising us and how we spend our money.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t stay when he drops his donation off. \u201cIt\u2019s not my business to chat to them,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to intrude. I hope that someone who doesn\u2019t have much in their cupboard can have some food that will be healthy. It is a demonstration that they are not alone. I don\u2019t want to be patronising, but I want you to feel a bit better about yourself because I bet you are feeling low. That is the emotional message I want to send with my tin of tuna. If I can boost someone\u2019s morale and show respect for them, then I am happy to do it.\u201d\n\nI am not easily shocked, but a few cases have been hard to hear. People come who say they haven\u2019t eaten for days\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sarah Chapman, who co-founded the Wandsworth food bank and volunteers every week, helps manager Dan Frith sort the donations. Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian\n\nRobson hands his tin of tuna, along with his other purchases, to Dan Frith, the food bank manager. Frith began working with Wandsworth\u2019s five newly opened centres last year when he returned from South Africa, where he had been working at a drop-in centre for street children.\n\n\u201cI was surprised by the food banks when I came back from South Africa,\u201d Frith says. \u201cI would like to say I am not easily shocked, but a few cases have been hard to hear. Sometimes there are people coming who say they haven\u2019t eaten for days. We offer tea and toast \u2013 sometimes we just observe how quickly people eat the toast and how they would not be themselves until they have eaten it.\u201d\n\nJustin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has said he was more shocked by meeting a hungry family at a food bank in the UK than by the suffering he had seen in African refugee camps, and Frith has wrestled with similar unease. \u201cYou can make comparisons,\u201d he says. \u201cThe rich and the poor really live on each other\u2019s doorsteps. That was quite shocking in South Africa, and London is like that, too. It must be linked to the recession, but I think we know that the need has been there for a while: it didn\u2019t just appear in 2010.\u201d\n\nSarah Chapman, who co-founded this food bank and volunteers here every week, helps to sort the donations and puts the tuna in the box of tinned fish and meat. \u201cI knew there was a need,\u201d she says. \u201cPreviously, local care professionals were buying food out of their own pockets.\u201d\n\nShe hovers between feeling pleased with the marshalling of community energies to help people and despondency at the rising need. \u201cWe hope that, long term, food banks won\u2019t be needed. We need to talk about why people come and what we can do to stop them from coming. I would be very uncomfortable if all we did was hand out food, thinking, \u2018This is nice!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhere are the safety nets when people are bereaved or ill? They should be paid enough so they can afford their own food\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Food bank volunteers sort goods arriving from donors at St Mark\u2019s Church in Clapham, south London. Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian\n\nLast year, 5,017 people were fed by Wandsworth\u2019s network of food banks; 24% said they needed help because of benefit delay, 19% because of benefit change, 23% because of low incomes. Chapman thinks the need for food banks has been increased by low wages and zero\u2011hours contracts. \u201cWhere are people\u2019s safety nets when they experience bereavement and illness? People should be paid wages that are high enough that they can afford their own food. But I don\u2019t see any evidence that we are going in the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe coalition has already cut \u00a320-\u00a325bn from the welfare state, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and George Osborne has said he wants to cut another \u00a312bn if he remains chancellor after the election. The national crisis loan system, whereby jobcentres paid out small grants and loans to vulnerable people in crisis situations (averaging around \u00a350), has been devolved to local authorities and claimants have found it much harder to get a loan. At the same time, there has been a shift away from a country where people in need could expect to turn to the state for essential support, and a step towards a new model where charity is embraced as an essential part of the welfare state.\n\nEmergency support is no longer something neutral and discreet; it often comes in the form of church handouts, which can bring unwelcome complications. Despite the best efforts of the charities, the donated food may not be what individuals need. Some outlets are supplied with supermarket castoffs, non-essential items such as bakewell tarts that haven\u2019t sold, unusual flavours of yoghurt (lemon and coconut) that no one wants to buy. It\u2019s not always fresh or a reliable source of sustenance. Oxfam has reported that some recipients are forced to return packages of rice, spaghetti and soup since, with no money, they are unable to pay for electricity to cook the food.\n\n\u201cWe should be deeply distressed that we are a country that has tolerated inequality for so long, and pleased that local people in local communities care deeply about their neighbours,\u201d says Chris Mould, chairman of the Trussell Trust. \u201cA lot of the people we have helped need not have been in the trouble they were in. Improved public services, better social security performance, would have helped prevent tens of thousands of people from getting into trouble.\u201d\n\nA lot of people are embarrassed or sad. When you say you've been through it, it makes them realise it's not their fault\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sandra Harding volunteers at the food bank because she once had to use it. Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian\n\nSandra Harding hands out tea to the people coming in. She volunteers here when she isn\u2019t working, because she knows what it\u2019s like to need help from a food bank; four years ago, she was on the receiving end. \u201cI felt humiliated, I suppose. That\u2019s maybe why I wanted to volunteer.\n\n\u201cI was in a lot of debt. I got a couple of bags of food. When they come in here, a lot of them are embarrassed or sad. When you tell them that you have been through it yourself, it breaks the ice. It makes them realise it is not their fault they are in that situation. People stand taller when they leave.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Trussell Trust is a Christian body, over the past four years food bank volunteers have emerged in all communities. Jagraj Singh volunteers at Sri Guru Singh Sabha Sikh temple in Southall, west London, which feeds up to 10,000 people weekly; anyone is welcome. Although numbers are not formally monitored, he has seen a sharp increase in non-Sikh visitors. \u201cWe are seeing more people who are down on their luck, who have become homeless,\u201d he says. Aware of the rising demand, volunteers are taking the Sikh practice of langar (offering a free communal meal) on to the streets of Southall and other parts of Britain.\n\nSynagogues and mosques have also started offering more food parcels. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just be waiting for these people to come to us,\u201d Singh says. \u201cWe should be going to them. We\u2019re feeding between 200 and 400 twice a week in Southall.\u201d\n\nChaunte Campbell, 23, takes home the tin of tuna donated by Robson, with a bag of provisions that also contains spaghetti bolognese, a jar of hot chocolate powder, some meatball sauce, soup, hot dogs, noodles, Aunt Bessie\u2019s dumpling mix, rice, longlife milk, Weetos, kitchen roll, toilet roll and apple juice.\n\nShe plans to make tuna bake for her five-year-old son that evening. \u201cTuna is expensive,\u201d she says, \u201cbut fish is good for you; I like to try him on different types of food. I boil the pasta. When it\u2019s nearly done, I put it into the glass dish, put cheese on it, mix in the tuna.\u201d\n\nThis is the fourth time she has been to the food bank this year. \u201cThe first time was when my son turned five and my benefit changed from income support to jobseeker\u2019s allowance. There was a delay. My money stopped, but they didn\u2019t tell me it was going to stop. I only found out when I looked at my bank account.\n\nMy money stopped, but they didn\u2019t tell me it was going to stop. I only found out when I looked at my bank account\n\nChaunte Campbell chats to Sarah Chapman, co-founder of the food bank. Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian\n\n\u201cI had to come a few times after that. The council tax payments stopped, the housing benefit was stopped, because of this change in circumstances. Days turned into weeks without it being resolved. I was really worried. I was thinking, \u2018I have no money, I have a small child, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019 I tried not to show him that mummy is going through problems. I didn\u2019t want him to think that something was wrong.\u201d\n\nThis time, her benefits have been reduced for two months, because she applied for only five jobs in a fortnight, when her agreement with the jobcentre stipulates that she should apply for six.\n\n\u201cThat was all I was able to do. I wouldn\u2019t apply for a job I know I couldn\u2019t do. There were jobs out of London \u2013 I knew I couldn\u2019t pick my son up and take him to school. I told them I was having problems looking for work. I said I have learning difficulties and I would like some help. They said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s easy.\u2019 The next time I went to the jobcentre, they said, \u2018Miss Campbell, how come you haven\u2019t applied for enough jobs? I will have to sanction you.\u2019 Now I only get \u00a360 a fortnight instead of \u00a3120. Money is very tight. I am looking, but I can\u2019t find any work; I\u2019ve been looking for childcare, retail, voluntary sector.\u201d\n\nThe food bank is two miles from Campbell\u2019s home. She takes the bus if she has enough money, otherwise she walks. She isn\u2019t embarrassed about using the food bank; she\u2019s angry, and wants to talk about it to help reduce the stigma. \u201cI want people to understand that there\u2019s no need to be embarrassed about going to these places, because they really do help you a lot.

Richard Brown, recovering from a series of heart attacks and recently split from his family, was told it would be three weeks before a claim for disability benefit would be processed. He was told he was not eligible for a crisis loan; in the meantime, he found himself living on \u201cthin air\u201d, and had to visit a food bank in Bournemouth.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to be embarrassed about going to these places.
