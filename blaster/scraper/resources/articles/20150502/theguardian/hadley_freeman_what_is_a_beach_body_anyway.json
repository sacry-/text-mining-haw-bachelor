But since then I have not been able to stop&#160;marvelling at him. For those of you still as&#160;ignorant of this man&#8217;s charms as I once was, I&#160;shall explain.</p>\n<p>Richard Staveley is the head of marketing at a&#160;company I shall call Sludge Drinks, so as not to give those twonks any further publicity. Sludge Drinks is one of those companies that claims drinking liquidised gunk, instead of eating&#160;actual food, is an excellent way to lose weight &#8211; if you&#8217;re a woman, that is. Notably, the &#8220;weight loss&#8221; section <a href=\"http://www.proteinworld.com\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">on the home page of the company&#8217;s website</a> is illustrated by a&#160;topless slim&#160;woman with &#8220;Sludge Drinks&#8221; written on her&#160;arse, like a branded piece of livestock. The&#160;&#8220;add muscle&#8221; section, on the other&#160;hand, is illustrated by a muscular man, his&#160;fist clenched tight with righteousness. Because women should be skinny and food-deprived, while men should be muscular and overloading on protein, just as God and Sludge Drinks intended.</p>\n<p>But I digress! Recently, Sludge Drinks launched&#160;an advertising campaign in train stations across the land that makes up in obnoxiousness what it lacks in grammar.<a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/incoming/article10193522.ece/alternates/w620/Beach-body.jpg\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\"> &#8220;ARE YOU BEACH BODY READY?&#8221; the bright yellow poster bellows</a>, illustrated by requisite woman in&#160;tiny bikini and&#160;a couple of Sludge Drinks&#8217; untempting-looking products.</p>\n<p>Reaction to this campaign has been, to use the&#160;favoured euphemism, mixed. Some women reportedly stood in front of the posters for hours, trying in vain to make sense of this nonsensical slogan. Others simply walked on past&#160;without noticing it, so used are they to women&#8217;s bodies being used to sell pointless products that no one&#160;needs. Then there are those who have taken a&#160;stand, arguing that any body that makes it to the&#160;beach is, literally, a beach body, so Sludge Drinks can shove their adverts up&#160;the part of their&#160;anatomy that is branded on their&#160;website. <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/proteinworld-arjun-seth-remove-are-you-beach-body-ready-advertisements\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">Petitions were launched</a>, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/beachbodyready?src=hash\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">social media mockery ensued</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/27/mass-demonstration-planned-over-beach-body-ready-tube-advert\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">a demonstration planned in London&#8217;s&#160;Hyde Park</a>.
