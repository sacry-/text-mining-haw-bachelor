From 1964, when her country copper, Reg Wexford, first stepped before the reading public in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/From-Doon-With-Death-Wexford/dp/0099534789\" class=\" u-underline\">From Doon with Death</a>, she wrote more than 50 crime novels and seven books of short stories. Many of them were adapted for television or made into feature films; the Wexford books in particular were an enormous success on TV, with the actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/oct/08/george-baker\" class=\" u-underline\">George Baker</a> playing Wexford as a big, gruff, rural policeman, solving crime in the fictional Sussex town of Kingsmarkham.</p>\n<p>But Rendell was never satisfied with producing the annual whodunnit. She demonstrated this when, rather than follow her first Wexford novel with more of the same, she daringly jumped away from the classic English mystery in her second book, To Fear a Painted Devil (1965), and gave readers a taste of the psychological thrillers to come.</p>\n\n<p> Related: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/02/ruth-rendell-in-quotes\" class=\" u-underline\">Ruth Rendell: In quotes</a> </p>\n\n<p>The clich&#233;d view of Rendell is that she suddenly changed her style when, in the 1980s, she started writing as Barbara Vine, but the truth is that from the beginning, even in the Wexford tales, she concentrated more on character and psychology than old-fashioned police procedure. She wrote 24 Wexford books and produced an equal number of thrillers under the name Rendell. Her first novel as Barbara Vine was A Dark-Adapted Eye (1986), which won the Mystery Writers of America&#8217;s Edgar Allan Poe award. The next year, a second Barbara Vine, A Fatal Inversion, won her the Crime Writers&#8217; Association Golden Dagger.</p>\n<p>The big difference with the Barbara Vine stories was that in them she went inside the heads of her psychopathic killers and rapists. It was this that made them so dark and chilling, an uncomfortable read for fans of Wexford who were used to the protection of the country officer standing between them and an unsafe world. Because of this, Rendell&#8217;s fans fell into two rather warring camps, those who liked the Wexford stories and those who felt that Barbara Vine was a great &#8220;real&#8221; novelist breaking new ground. The books were all, however, bestsellers.</p>\n<p>There might also have been a third camp, those who loved her wonderful short stories. This was a dying, or dead, market in Britain, but Rendell was able to sell short stories in the US to publications such as the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.</p>\n<p>Although Rendell did not like the title often bestowed on her &#8211; queen of crime &#8211; calling it snide and sexist, she did not go along with the many reviewers, among them AN Wilson and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/27/pd-james\" class=\" u-underline\">PD James</a>, who called her a great novelist. &#8220;Nobody in their senses is going to call me a first-class writer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind because I do the very best that I can and thousands, millions of people enjoy my books.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/books/2015/may/02/ruth-rendell-obituary-crime-writer#img-1\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/15/1421327195679/54352400-07dc-4ba0-bddb-0aa4f082e972-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"George Baker as Detective Chief Inspector Reg Wexford and Louie Ramsay as Dora Wexford in The Ruth Rendell Mysteries in 1988.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F44qjz%2Fsfb%23img-1&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ruth+Rendell+obituary&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F44qjz%2Fstw%23img-1\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Ruth+Rendell+obituary&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2015%2Fmay%2F02%2Fruth-rendell-obituary-crime-writer&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F1%2F15%2F1421327196584%2F54352400-07dc-4ba0-bddb-0aa4f082e972-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nGeorge Baker as Detective Chief Inspector Reg Wexford and Louie Ramsay as Dora Wexford in ITV&#8217;s The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, 1988.
