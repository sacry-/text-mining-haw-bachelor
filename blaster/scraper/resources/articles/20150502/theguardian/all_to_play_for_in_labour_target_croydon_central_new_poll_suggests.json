Last year&#8217;s council elections pointed that way too, with Croydon Council <a href=\"http://thecroydoncitizen.com/politics-society/labour-win-croydon-council-elections/\" class=\" u-underline\">turning to red from blue</a>. But US master pollster Nate Silver has <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/uk-general-election-predictions/\" class=\" u-underline\">predicted</a> a Tory hold, with 42.4% of the vote compared with Labour&#8217;s 40%.

A long term Lib Dem collapse will be part of the reason for that. But if there really is a late shift towards Barwell locally at Jones&#8217;s expense, the prime suspect will come as no surprise.<br></p>\n<p>&#8220;The Ukip share in the seat has nearly halved, from 19% to 10%, since the October poll,&#8221; Ashcroft <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2015/05/mixed-fortunes-in-my-final-round-of-marginals/?utm_source=Lord+Ashcroft+Polls&amp;utm_campaign=7c1a44f2fa-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_b70c7aec0a-7c1a44f2fa-71660429\" class=\" u-underline\">writes</a> of what he calls &#8220;the most striking&#8221; of his final batch of UK constituency polls. It&#8217;s also <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2015/05/croydon-central/\" class=\" u-underline\">down from 13% in March</a>. Ukip&#8217;s ratings in London trail their national share, but the party&#8217;s purchase is likely to be greater at the suburban fringes of the metropolis than in its &#8220;super-diverse&#8221; inner city core. The party has been hurting the Conservative more than Labour in London and if enough of its supporters heed Boris Johnson&#8217;s call to &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3049458/Boris-urges-Ukip-supporters-swing-Conservatives-avoid-nightmare-Labour-government.html\" class=\" u-underline\">come home</a>&#8221; to the Tories, they could be the ones who save Croydon Central for his party. <br></p>\n<p>Barwell, a former head of the Conservatives&#8217; target seats campaign who, incidentally, used to work for Ashcroft, has been pushing the &#8220;SNP ransom&#8221; fear angle.
