At its inception, in the wake of war, the Holland festival was one of the cultural celebrations intended to revive Europe, alongside Edinburgh, Avignon and Vienna. Despite its longevity and its significance inside the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands\" class=\" u-underline\">Netherlands</a>, large numbers of British fans of music, theatre, art and ballet have so far failed to mark the festival on their calendar.

Some are middle-aged couples engaged in a pleasant round of cultural box-ticking: others are young students, dutifully scanning European art treasures. None I spoke to were aware of the Holland festival. Naturally, Mackenzie thinks this is silly, and particularly for Brits, because the festival is a chance to see good European art before it comes to London, as well as to sample oddities that probably never will. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually often easier to get out here than it is to get to Edinburgh,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It is only 45 minutes in a plane from London and there are direct trains too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A big draw this year is British artist Liam Gillick, who will contribute his first piece of art using the human form.

This element of public participation picks up on a theme of shared experience for 2015. The festival will open with a DJ live-streaming a bespoke party mix into the homes of anyone who wants to join in.
