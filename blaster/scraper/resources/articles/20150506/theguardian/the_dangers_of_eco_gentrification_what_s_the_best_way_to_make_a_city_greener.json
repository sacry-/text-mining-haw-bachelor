When the very first public park in Europe, <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolparks.org/red/docs/parks/birkenhead_park/index.html\" class=\" u-underline\">Birkenhead Park on Merseyside</a>, was in the early phases of planning in the 1840s, park commissioners bought up parcels of land around the park and cashed in after it was built. Similarly, one of the main reasons behind the construction of New York City&#8217;s Central Park &#8211; designed by Frederick Law Olmsted after a trip to Birkenhead &#8211; was to raise property values and tax revenues for the city. (Olmsted himself carried out a series of studies on rising land values around the park from the mid-1850s to the mid-1870s, and used these findings to obtain support for the creation of parks in other cities.)</p>\n<p>In our present neoliberal era, this process has been further amplified. Large-scale projects for &#8220;greening&#8221; cities, such as the High Line, have become bigger and more targeted to more specific audiences, contributing to the problem of residential segregation. In New York City, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/26/new-york-lowline-underground-park-high-line\" class=\" u-underline\">a proposed &#8220;Lowline&#8221; is scheduled to open</a> in the Lower East Side in 2018. <a href=\"http://www.absolut.com/en/News/Art/An-underground-walk-in-the-park/\" class=\" u-underline\">Funded in part by Absolut Vodka</a>, the clientele of this underground park-museum is easily identified. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/19/thames-garden-bridge-approved-london-mayor-boris-johnson\" class=\" u-underline\">Also expected in 2018 is the London Garden Bridge</a>, presumably geared toward a similar, cocktail-oriented crowd.<br></p>\n<p>Increasing the segregation of cities is not, of course, what the creators of these and other projects intended. But these plans nevertheless reflect a rather narrow-minded vision of what it means to bring nature into the city. They also appear to turn a blind eye to the drawbacks of endeavours such as the High Line &#8211; not only for moderate-income residents but for everyone in the city, no matter what their income level.</p>\n<p>Such a myopic approach is a sign of our times: we want big projects that can be &#8220;unveiled&#8221; to spectators at a specific point in time. In reality, a more modest, piecemeal approach is often better both for the environment and for the socio-economic composition of large cities. Ideally, smaller-scale projects would be implemented in neighbourhoods across urban areas simultaneously.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/cities/2015/may/06/dangers-ecogentrification-best-way-make-city-greener#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/15/1429095524052/53f74f48-b251-4e4d-aa2b-7476dadfc86a-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Birkenhead Park in Merseyside.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F47d4n%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+dangers+of+eco-gentrification%3A+what%27s+the+best+way+to+make+a+city+greener%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F47d4n%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The+dangers+of+eco-gentrification%3A+what%27s+the+best+way+to+make+a+city+greener%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcities%2F2015%2Fmay%2F06%2Fdangers-ecogentrification-best-way-make-city-greener&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F15%2F1429095524676%2F53f74f48-b251-4e4d-aa2b-7476dadfc86a-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nBirkenhead Park in Merseyside was the first public park in Europe.
