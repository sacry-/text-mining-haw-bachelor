A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for Ed Miliband.\n\nOh, and a vote for the SNP is a vote for Ed Miliband.\n\nTheresa May is writing in the Express, saying that \u201ca vote for any other party\u201d is a vote for Ed Miliband. Essentially, everything apart from a Conservative vote is a vote for Ed Miliband. OK?\n\nBut hold on. The Express has a gasp-inducing exclusive that Nigel Farage thinks you really rather ought to vote for Ukip:\n\n\u2014 Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) DAILY EXPRESS: Why you must vote for UKIP #tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers pic.twitter.com/jcKZG4hrWs\n\nThere might be bit more surprise to be mustered in the news that Boris Johnson thinks that \u201cmoderate, sensible, one-nation, middle-of-the-road Blairite Guardian reader[s]\u201d should cast their votes in the Tory box.\n\nSo what is the undecided voter to do? You could try the Guardian\u2019s guide to what the parties are offering you. You could read their manifestos (quickly). Or you could just see what the media would like you to do. Let\u2019s do that:\n\ntl;dr: newspaper endorsements in a word(ish)\n\nGuardian Tories tawdry; Labour hope; Lib Dems/Greens/SNP: not the answer.

But do let me know if you spot a link.\n\nRead these\n\nIn the Times, Alice Thomson says we ought to be a bit kinder to our MPs:\n\nOf the last intake of Tory MPs in 2010, nearly a quarter are now separated or divorced. Many are struggling to make ends meet, usually expected to live in two places, with a resentful spouse keeping everything together while they vote late in Westminster and hold surgeries at weekends. They know they can\u2019t complain.\n\n\n\nIn the Daily Mail, Sarah Vine gives the spouse\u2019s verdict on five years of being married to a cabinet minister (that\u2019s Michael Gove):\n\nThe civil service is a complete misnomer. It is neither civil nor a service. It regards elected members as a minor inconvenience and their so-called policies as an occupational hazard. Thus most of their energies are directed to thwarting the wishes of ministers \u2026 If you really want to get something done, forget MPs and ministers. The people with the true power are a group of 20-something women: the private secretaries. They are the ones doing the work while everyone else does the shouting. Even the permanent secretaries respect them \u2014 which is saying something.\n\nIn the Financial Times, Martin Wolf questions the Tory record on the economy:\n\nWhatever one thinks of the fiscal policies of the coalition, a weak and unbalanced recovery from a huge recession is not a vindication. The UK faces really big economic challenges. It confronts equally huge questions about its place in the world and in Europe, as well as its own constitutional future. Neither main party offers convincing responses to these challenges. Have no illusion: real competence is not on offer, either in economics or, in truth, much else.\n\nAnd with surely the scoop of the day is the Herald, which has tracked down the woman photographed with Alex Salmond in 1999 and popularly known as \u201cSolero girl\u201d (much to the chagrin of Buzzfeed\u2019s Jamie Ross, who has been on her trail for some time). She is Kate Adamson, who now lives in Melbourne. And she\u2019d like you to vote SNP.\n\n\u2014 Herald Scotland (@heraldscotland) Sorry @JamieRoss7 we've tracked down @AlexSalmond 's Solero girl - and she prefers a Zoom http://t.co/PC7wPA9Izb pic.twitter.com/d2nK64qn6x\n\nThe day in a tweet\n\n\u2014 Robin Ince (@robinince) I wonder what an election without extreme newspaper propaganda would be like? I presume it would be too confusing for all of us.\n\nIf today were a box set, it would be\u2026\n\n24. Counting down an hour at a time, dogged types working through the night, a plot chock-full of cliffhangers, and nobody ever needing to go to the bathroom.\n\n24, Season 3, starring Kiefer Sutherland.

By this morning, Netanyahu is obliged by law to have put together a new government or step aside as prime minister.",
