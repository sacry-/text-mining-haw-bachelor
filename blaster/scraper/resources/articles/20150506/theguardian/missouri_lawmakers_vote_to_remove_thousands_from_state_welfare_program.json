The law also imposes stricter work requirements. </p>\n<p>The Republican-led house voted 113-42 to override Governor Jay Nixon&#8217;s veto, largely along party lines. The senate voted 25-9 to override the veto on Monday. </p>\n<p>Shortly after the vote, Nixon announced that he had vetoed another Republican-backed bill paring back the social safety net. That bill would reduce the duration of unemployment rates from the current 20 weeks to as few as 13 weeks by linking the length to the state&#8217;s unemployment rate. </p>\n<p>Republican lawmakers already have said they will try to override the veto of the jobless benefits bill. But the house fell well short of the two-thirds majority that would be needed when the bill originally was sent to Nixon last month. The house also failed to override Nixon&#8217;s veto of a similar unemployment bill last year. </p>\n<p>Both measures are part of a push by Republicans in several states to curtail spending on social programs in a way that they say encourages personal responsibility. In neighboring Kansas, Governor Sam Brownback, a Republican, signed a measure earlier this year to prohibit spending cash assistance on recreational activities such as swimming pools and movies. </p>\n<p>Missouri Republicans argued that low-income families ultimately would benefit by receiving government aid for less time. </p>\n<p>&#8220;They want their independence; they don&#8217;t want to be in this poverty trap all their lives and they don&#8217;t want their kids to be in this poverty trap. They want and they say that we can be successful if we have the tools,&#8221; said Representative Diane Franklin, who handled the bill in the House. </p>\n<p>About 3,000 families are projected to lose benefits - which are capped at $292 a month for a parent with two children - because of the lower lifetime limit starting 1 January, according to the department of social services. Nixon said that translates to about 6,400 children. </p>\n<p>The law will make Missouri among the top 10 states for the shortest duration of benefits. </p>\n<p>Senate president Pro Tem Tom Dempsey, R-St. Charles, said the Legislature was &#8220;not cutting welfare&#8221; but instead &#8220;restructuring the system&#8221; and &#8220;reinvesting the savings&#8221; into such things as child care, job training and transportation for low-income families. </p>\n<p>When Nixon vetoed the welfare bill last week, he cited concerns that it would punish children for the actions of their parents by imposing sanctions on the entire family if a parent does not comply with work requirements. </p>\n<p>Individuals would have six weeks after a face-to-face meeting with a social worker before losing half of the family&#8217;s benefits. All benefits would be cut off after an additional 10 weeks. About 6,600 families could lose benefits for not meeting work requirements, according to the Social Services Department. </p>\n<p> &#8220;The responsibility is not with the government. It&#8217;s with the families. It&#8217;s with the parents if they decide not to comply with the work activity requirement,&#8221; said Sen.
