Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the specifications, LG has made a curious choice of processor for the G4. Typically, flagship smartphones use top-of-the-line processors, but the G4 is fitted with Qualcomm&#8217;s six-core Snapdragon 808, not the chip company&#8217;s most powerful Octacore 810.</p>\n<p>That could be to do with reported overheating issues in the 810. Either way the G4 is snappy and responsive with no hint of lag or lack of performance.</p>\n<p>A side-by-side real-world test of the G4 against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/23/samsung-galaxy-s6-review-android-smartphone\" class=\" u-underline\">Samsung Galaxy S6</a> showed very little difference in response to loading apps, playing games and navigating through menus.</p>\n<p>Where the G4 has the edge is in battery life. I easily got two solid days of work out of the G4 on a single charge, with push email all day, many hundreds of push notifications, some streaming music and 20 or so camera snaps.</p>\n<p>The LG4 lacks built-in wireless charging, requiring an optional case, and charges slower than many of the competition, but then you have to charge it half as much.</p>\n<h2>Simple, fast and tap-happy</h2>\n\n\n<a href=\"/technology/2015/may/06/lg-g4-review-one-of-best-phablets-available-impressive-camera#img-4\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819113213/c98aaa36-6cb8-4b82-b533-e0942375d6a2-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"LG G4 review\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F484nh%2Fsfb%23img-4&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=LG+G4+review%3A+one+of+the+best+phablets+available%2C+boasting+an+impressive+camera&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F484nh%2Fstw%23img-4\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=LG+G4+review%3A+one+of+the+best+phablets+available%2C+boasting+an+impressive+camera&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fmay%2F06%2Flg-g4-review-one-of-best-phablets-available-impressive-camera&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F5%2F1430819113529%2F2b49a439-f97c-469b-b8e9-5248fb5ffa51-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nLG&#8217;s Smart Bulletin is a Google Now-style information screen, which works well enough, but can be safely ignored in favour of the latter if everything you do is plugged into the search giant&#8217;s ecosystem. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>LG customises the standard Android experience on its smartphones. Typically the system is colourful and full of options for the owner.</p>\n<p>The changes to G4&#8217;s Android are simpler and mostly welcome. For instance, users can customise the arrangement of the standard Android home, back and multi-tasking soft keys or change the typeface and text size.

Both work well and should be standard to Android.</p>\n<h2>Camera</h2>\n\n\n<a href=\"/technology/2015/may/06/lg-g4-review-one-of-best-phablets-available-impressive-camera#img-5\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819667524/b82a1f9d-f1c2-4228-9f3f-1793852c6e76-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"LG G4 review\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F484nh%2Fsfb%23img-5&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=LG+G4+review%3A+one+of+the+best+phablets+available%2C+boasting+an+impressive+camera&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F484nh%2Fstw%23img-5\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=LG+G4+review%3A+one+of+the+best+phablets+available%2C+boasting+an+impressive+camera&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fmay%2F06%2Flg-g4-review-one-of-best-phablets-available-impressive-camera&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F5%2F1430819668112%2Ff16d59a9-8c09-42df-9040-10804c03b4c1-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nThe camera&#8217;s manual controls are easy to use, with simple virtual scrolling wheels featuring manual focus, while the automatic mode manages most situations well. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>The G4&#8217;s camera has some of the best low-light performance I have ever tested on a smartphone. It has an F-stop of 1.8 (a measure of the speed of the lens: the lower the number, the brighter the image captured).</p>\n<p>Most smartphones have camera lenses above two. The iPhone 6 has an F-stop of 2.2. Some, like the Galaxy S6, have F-stops of 1.9. For perspective, the prime lens on my Nikon digital SLR, which I used to take photos of the G4, has an F-stop of 1.8.</p>\n<p>Numbers aside, the G4 makes dull days and indoor shots look like bright sunlight, with no graining or artefacts. Images are sharp and detailed, colour-accurate and vibrant, while the camera focuses fast. The shallow depth of field is also quite remarkable, creating pleasing bokeh effects.</p>\n<p>The camera app has a manual mode, which gives users access to white balance, focus, ISO, shutter speed and RAW image files, each adjustable with an easy-to-use slider. The automatic mode does an excellent job of managing most situations, however.</p>\n<p>The front-facing camera is also one of the best I&#8217;ve tried, once you turn off the automatic make-up effect.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/technology/2015/may/06/lg-g4-review-one-of-best-phablets-available-impressive-camera#img-6\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430820609575/7c4054e7-3e9f-4145-866a-9e7c1dcef9d0-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"LG G4 review\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F484nh%2Fsfb%23img-6&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=LG+G4+review%3A+one+of+the+best+phablets+available%2C+boasting+an+impressive+camera&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F484nh%2Fstw%23img-6\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=LG+G4+review%3A+one+of+the+best+phablets+available%2C+boasting+an+impressive+camera&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fmay%2F06%2Flg-g4-review-one-of-best-phablets-available-impressive-camera&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F5%2F1430820610185%2Ff05a5cda-41a6-4ef8-af4c-4736f0251f59-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nThe shallow depth of field of the G4 rivals digital SLR prime lenses.

For comparison, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S6 screen has a pixel density of 577ppi and Apple\u2019s iPhone 6 Plus 401ppi.\n\nSpecifications\n\nScreen: 5.5in quad HD (538ppi) \u201cQuantum\u201d display\n\n\n\n5.5in quad HD (538ppi) \u201cQuantum\u201d display Processor: Six-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808\n\n\n\nSix-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 RAM: 3GB\n\n\n\n3GB Storage: 32GB + microSD card slot\n\n\n\n32GB + microSD card slot Operating system: Android 5.1 Lollipop\n\n\n\nAndroid 5.1 Lollipop Camera: 16MP rear (F-stop 1.8), 8MP selfie-cam\n\n\n\n16MP rear (F-stop 1.8), 8MP selfie-cam Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi ac, BT 4.1, NFC\n\n\n\nLTE, Wi-Fi ac, BT 4.1, NFC Dimensions: 148.9 x 76.1 x 9.8mm\n\n\n\n148.9 x 76.1 x 9.8mm Weight: 155g\n\n\n\nTwo days per charge\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Expandable storage of up to 200GB via microSD and a large, removable battery are what sets the G4 apart from the competition. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\nLooking at the specifications, LG has made a curious choice of processor for the G4. Typically, flagship smartphones use top-of-the-line processors, but the G4 is fitted with Qualcomm\u2019s six-core Snapdragon 808, not the chip company\u2019s most powerful Octacore 810.\n\nThat could be to do with reported overheating issues in the 810. Either way the G4 is snappy and responsive with no hint of lag or lack of performance.\n\nA side-by-side real-world test of the G4 against the Samsung Galaxy S6 showed very little difference in response to loading apps, playing games and navigating through menus.\n\nWhere the G4 has the edge is in battery life. I easily got two solid days of work out of the G4 on a single charge, with push email all day, many hundreds of push notifications, some streaming music and 20 or so camera snaps.\n\nThe LG4 lacks built-in wireless charging, requiring an optional case, and charges slower than many of the competition, but then you have to charge it half as much.\n\nSimple, fast and tap-happy\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest LG\u2019s Smart Bulletin is a Google Now-style information screen, which works well enough, but can be safely ignored in favour of the latter if everything you do is plugged into the search giant\u2019s ecosystem. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\nLG customises the standard Android experience on its smartphones. Typically the system is colourful and full of options for the owner.\n\nThe changes to G4\u2019s Android are simpler and mostly welcome. For instance, users can customise the arrangement of the standard Android home, back and multi-tasking soft keys or change the typeface and text size. A super-simple interface for \u201cbeginners\u201d \u2013 LG\u2019s words \u2013 is also available.\n\nLG\u2019s Smart Bulletin homescreen panel aims to be a Google Now replacement, pulling information from calendars, health tracking apps and the weather.\n\nPerhaps LG\u2019s best addition to Android is its KnockOn and KnockCode \u2013 double tap to wake or sleep the screen, or tap out a lock code on a black screen to unlock the phone. Both work well and should be standard to Android.\n\nCamera\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The camera\u2019s manual controls are easy to use, with simple virtual scrolling wheels featuring manual focus, while the automatic mode manages most situations well. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\nThe G4\u2019s camera has some of the best low-light performance I have ever tested on a smartphone. It has an F-stop of 1.8 (a measure of the speed of the lens: the lower the number, the brighter the image captured).\n\nMost smartphones have camera lenses above two. The iPhone 6 has an F-stop of 2.2. Some, like the Galaxy S6, have F-stops of 1.9. For perspective, the prime lens on my Nikon digital SLR, which I used to take photos of the G4, has an F-stop of 1.8.\n\nNumbers aside, the G4 makes dull days and indoor shots look like bright sunlight, with no graining or artefacts. Images are sharp and detailed, colour-accurate and vibrant, while the camera focuses fast. The shallow depth of field is also quite remarkable, creating pleasing bokeh effects.\n\nThe camera app has a manual mode, which gives users access to white balance, focus, ISO, shutter speed and RAW image files, each adjustable with an easy-to-use slider. The automatic mode does an excellent job of managing most situations, however.\n\nThe front-facing camera is also one of the best I\u2019ve tried, once you turn off the automatic make-up effect.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The shallow depth of field of the G4 rivals digital SLR prime lenses. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\nPrice\n\nThe LG G4 will be available at the end of May, costing around \u00a3500 without a mobile phone contract.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe LG G4 is a power-user\u2019s Android smartphone. A removable battery, expandable storage and brilliant camera make up for the cheap design and materials, as every other mainstream manufacturer prefers to spend on the latter. But it doesn\u2019t feel as premium, and isn\u2019t made from metal, although leather options are available.\n\nAesthetics aside, solid performance, two-day battery life and a great 5.5in screen make the G4 one of the most usable and best phablets available.\n\nPros: great screen, brilliant camera, two-day battery, expandable storage, removable battery, KnockCode. Cons: lack of premium materials, plastic back easily scratched, no built-in wireless charging.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The fit and finish of the G4 with the plastic back isn\u2019t quite up to par with rivals from Apple or Samsung.
