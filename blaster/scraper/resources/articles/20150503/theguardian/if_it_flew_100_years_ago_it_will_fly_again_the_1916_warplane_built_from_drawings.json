We can&#8217;t afford any mistakes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The tiny carving is actually a wing part for a magnificent replica of one of the first ever first world war fighter planes, the Sopwith 1&#189; Strutter, designed to counter the German air threat and defend the British coastline from enemy attack.</p>\n<p> More than 2,750 other such parts form what amounts to a huge Airfix kit of the plane, currently under construction in the hangar of the National Museum of Flight in East Fortune, East Lothian. For 13 years, Ginty and his fellow volunteers have devoted their time to rebuilding the 1&#189; Strutter piece by piece. Next year, on the 100th anniversary of its maiden flight, the men hope their Strutter will take to the skies.</p>\n<p> Aged between 68 and 93, the 13 volunteers must be among the oldest self-educated aeronautical engineers in the world. Their skillset ranges from metal work and carpentry to draughtsmanship and radar expertise, though some were simply Meccano enthusiasts as children.</p>\n<p>Speaking from their hangar, Ginty explains: &#8220;Our goal is to have the aircraft flying by next year. Most men when they retire don&#8217;t have giant toys like this to play with. I consider us extremely fortunate to have a place to indulge our hobbies&#8211; and decent wives for putting up with us.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/science/2015/may/03/if-it-flew-100-years-ago-it-will-fly-again-the-1916-warplane-built-from-drawings#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/30/1430402600986/16262f56-571e-4173-a26b-251748d0a8b2-300x230.jpeg\" alt=\"Strutter\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48xbq%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=If+it+flew+100+years+ago%2C+it+will+fly+again%3A+the+1916+warplane+built+from+drawings&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48xbq%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=If+it+flew+100+years+ago%2C+it+will+fly+again%3A+the+1916+warplane+built+from+drawings&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fscience%2F2015%2Fmay%2F03%2Fif-it-flew-100-years-ago-it-will-fly-again-the-1916-warplane-built-from-drawings&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F30%2F1430402601372%2F16262f56-571e-4173-a26b-251748d0a8b2-2060x1576.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nThe vital statistics for the 1&#189; Strutter.
