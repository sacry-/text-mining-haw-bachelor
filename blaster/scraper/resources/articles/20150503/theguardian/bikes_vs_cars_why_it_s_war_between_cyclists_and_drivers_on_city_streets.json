  "article_html": "<div><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RlNopfAV-o\" class=\" u-underline\">Fredrik Gertten</a> is a Swedish documentary-maker: he made a film about the banana industry, <a href=\"http://www.bananasthemovie.com/\" class=\" u-underline\">and then he made a film about being sued by the banana industry</a>. He has recently been anointed one of Sweden&#8217;s &#8220;top environmentalists&#8221; &#8211; which, although the title is fairly broad, has got to be good. And he has now made <a href=\"http://www.bikes-vs-cars.com/\" class=\" u-underline\">Bikes vs Cars</a>, which is as confronting &#8211; though I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d call it exactly confrontational &#8211; as you would expect.</p>\n<p>I have, give or take, mainly peddled the line that it&#8217;s not a war between the two-wheeled and the four-wheeled: how could it be, when a lot of us are both drivers and cyclists (and sometimes, inevitably, also pedestrians)? It seemed to me, much as it does on the road itself, safer not to be adversarial. This film&#8217;s message &#8211; from the streets of S&#227;o Paulo to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles\" class=\" u-underline\">Los Angeles</a>, via the toxic situation in Toronto &#8211; makes it plain that a war is exactly what it is: cities are designed for cars and are hostile to bikes. And cars are not designed for life.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Car dependency,&#8221; Gertten says, &#8220;is a disease for society. If you&#8217;re dependent on having a car every day, you have lost your freedom. It&#8217;s very sad. Most people are unhappy in traffic. The people who bike their cities, they become city-lovers. When you&#8217;re in a car, you don&#8217;t see the city, you are only watching the road. On a bike, you can see the sky, you can see the trees. People get to know their countries in a different way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The way he describes it, which comes across even more intensely in the film, is not so much a clash between bikes and cars as a battle of love and hate. How do you know the contours of where you live? Do you dart across them like an urban hummingbird? Or do you crawl sightlessly along them in a tank?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Car, oil and construction industries understand we need to change, but their business depends on the fact that we don't</p>\n\nFredrik Gertten, film-maker\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to say that what we have out there is not a natural development,&#8221; adds Gertten. &#8220;Sometimes we believe that traffic is a natural thing, like water. But it&#8217;s actually man-made. So the whole LA segment of the film is partly about how it all started and then, of course, what we are up against when we want to change our cities. Because the car industry, the oil industry, the construction industry &#8211; they all understand that we need to change, but their business depends on the fact that we don&#8217;t change.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Plenty of appalling tragedies beset cyclists in his film, which has just been released in selected UK cinemas. Memorably, for sheer gruesome detail, there&#8217;s a man in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/saopaulo\" class=\" u-underline\">S&#227;o Paulo</a> who had his arm torn off by a car. The driver didn&#8217;t stop, drove another five miles, dropped off a friend, then tossed the arm in a creek. The bikers of the city had a vigil for him; they were expecting 1,000 people, but didn&#8217;t get them. As one of the campaigners says ruefully: &#8220;In reality, Facebook is a fake recruiter&#8221;, which I think anyone who&#8217;s ever tried to organise anything can get behind. But for all that, at the end of the film, it&#8217;s the car-drivers you feel really sorry for. It just looks so miserable, so choked, so futile, so wasteful: not of the planet&#8217;s resources, but of your actual life. In S&#227;o Paulo, commuters spend an average of three hours a day in traffic. Los Angeles looks like a patient with a chronic disorder: when the roads seize up, the citizens are paralysed. In the city of the go-getter, they may as well stay in bed.</p>\n<p>As the statistics on car use thunder out, with already bursting capital cities facing huge growth in demand and afforability, a picture comes into focus: maybe this is it, the point at which perpetual growth meets the limits of the Earth. I always thought it would be something more elemental, like food or minerals, but transport seems to be a few rungs up on the hierarchy of needs. The vivid absurdity of trying to cram more and more cars into the same crawling, dystopian channels makes the case for sustainability without even trying. &#8220;I don&#8217;t even think it&#8217;s about growth or not growth,&#8221; Gertten says equably. &#8220;Growth needs to be sustainable to be counted as growth, otherwise it&#8217;s just destroying things.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/film/2015/may/03/bikes-vs-cars-film-war-cyclists-drivers-fredrik-gertten-interview#img-1\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430498616855/0a21f156-f6ae-41d9-b945-8c78de20bfc9-300x207.jpeg\" alt=\"Vehicles crawl along a major road in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4839d%2Fsfb%23img-1&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bikes+vs+Cars%3A+why+it%E2%80%99s+war+between+cyclists+and+drivers+on+city+streets&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4839d%2Fstw%23img-1\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Bikes+vs+Cars%3A+why+it%E2%80%99s+war+between+cyclists+and+drivers+on+city+streets&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2015%2Fmay%2F03%2Fbikes-vs-cars-film-war-cyclists-drivers-fredrik-gertten-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F1%2F1430498615465%2F0a21f156-f6ae-41d9-b945-8c78de20bfc9-2060x1421.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nVehicles crawl along a major road in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil.
