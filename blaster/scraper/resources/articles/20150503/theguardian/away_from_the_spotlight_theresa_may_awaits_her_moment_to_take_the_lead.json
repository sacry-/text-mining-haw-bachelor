Theaudience is noticeably mixed in ages &#8211; there are almost as many youngish couples as older people &#8211; and each of them has paid a &#163;5 charity fee to perch on stiff plastic chairs while children can be heard shrieking from the swimming pool next door. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to see a United Kingdom that continues to be open and entrepreneurial and go-getting,&#8221; says May from the stage, opening her pitch in what is, for the candidates, their second hustings of the day, and their fourth or fifth of the campaign. The statement wins applause in sections of the audience, as do most of the incumbent&#8217;s answers. An exit poll taken as people file out records May as the runaway winner.</p>\n<p>But if an emphatic Conservative victory in the home secretary&#8217;s seat is all but assured, the party&#8217;s failure to replicate that result on a national scale means there could well be a vacancy at its head very soon.
