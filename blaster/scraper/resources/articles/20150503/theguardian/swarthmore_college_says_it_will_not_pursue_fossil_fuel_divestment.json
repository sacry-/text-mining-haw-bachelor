The board pledged to create a separate Green Fund that would not invest directly or indirectly in fossil fuels for those alumni who wished to donate to that way, based on their beliefs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Climate change is the most pressing issue of our time and Swarthmore College can &#8211; and must &#8211; play a leadership role in helping to curb the seemingly insatiable appetite for fossil fuel,&#8221; the statement said.</p>\n<p>But it went on to say that the most effective way to do so was to focus on &#8220;reducing both individual and institutional consumption of fossil fuels&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The board expressed concern over the college&#8217;s ability to sustain returns on investment if it were to try to switch any of its $1.9bn endowment to fund managers committed to avoiding any equity in coal, oil and natural gas producers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After long and deep discussion and debate, the board decided not to modify its investment guidelines to allow for use of the endowment to meet social objectives. This decision effectively ratifies the board&#8217;s September 2013 decision not to divest from fossil fuels, either on a full or partial basis,&#8221; the statement read.</p>\n<p>The student divestment campaign accused the board of standing &#8220;on the wrong side of history&#8221; in the effort to curb climate change.<br></p>\n<p>O&#8217;Hanlon said that impoverished communities around the world were already feeling the &#8220;deadly impact of climate change&#8221; and expressed dismay at the board&#8217;s decision.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By not acting, our board of managers is complicit with that destruction. The college risks losing our reputation as a leader for social justice issues. Will we be remembered as a leader or a follower on these issues?&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>More than 350 former students of Swarthmore had said they would not donate any more money to the college unless it divested from coal, oil and gas equities, as part of a campaign to protest against inaction on climate change. More than 1,000 alumni signed a petition calling on the board to do so.</p>\n<p>The Swarthmore student movement is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/08/fossil-fuel-divestment-a-brief-history\" class=\" u-underline\">considered to have launched</a> the growing worldwide effort to persuade education establishments to take their money out of coal, oil and gas companies.</p>\n<p>Student activists at Swarthmore began a movement five years ago, urging the college to stop allowing any of its $1.9bn endowment to be invested in fossil fuel companies.
