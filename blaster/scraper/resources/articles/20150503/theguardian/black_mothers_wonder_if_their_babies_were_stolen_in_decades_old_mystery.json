None of the women are seeking money, he said. </p>\n<p>Watkins has no idea who, or how many people, may have been responsible if babies were being taken, though he believes they were stolen and put up for adoption in an era when there were few adoption agencies catering to black couples. </p>\n<p>Homer G Phillips Hospital opened in 1937 as a blacks-only hospital at a time when St Louis was segregated.
