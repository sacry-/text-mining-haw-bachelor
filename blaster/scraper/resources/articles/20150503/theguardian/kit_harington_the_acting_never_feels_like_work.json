The pilot was a disaster and the series nearly didn&#8217;t get made. Harington was already enjoying a starburst career in the theatre. After graduating from Central School of Speech and Drama in 2008 he won a part in War Horse at the National and when the Game of Thrones pilot was shot, he was preparing for Posh &#8211; Laura Wade&#8217;s vicious satire on the Bullingdon Club &#8211; at the Royal Court. Remembering this earlier time, Harington&#8217;s face lights up.&#8220;My big tick list was the National, the Royal Court and the Donmar, and I&#8217;d just done the National. Lyndsey Turner, who directed Posh, is scarily intelligent. I remember we had six weeks&#8217; rehearsal time, and for four and a half of them she just sat us round a table, really nailing each character. It was really Stanislavskian method, really intense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The blueish tinge to Harington&#8217;s blood is often placed high up in his biography: he&#8217;s a direct descendant of Charles II, his great-grandfather was a baronet, and he&#8217;s named after Christopher Marlowe. I wonder if the toxic Hooray Henrys portrayed resonated with his own childhood. &#8220;I think I was one of only two in the cast who didn&#8217;t go to private school. My dad went to Westminster, so I was vaguely aware of that kind of thing, but I hadn&#8217;t experienced it myself.

Kit&#8217;s mother, Deborah, taught creative writing at Birmingham University and wrote plays on the side. &#8220;I remember going to see some of her plays when we were young. It caused her a lot of stress. On the night of the premiere she would grip my hand so hard it hurt. Afterwards she would rush out of the theatre with her hands over her ears before she could hear anyone say anything about it. It&#8217;s the same for me. We spoke about it recently and bonded over it. It was terrifying for her, and I have the same thing now when I go to a premiere of one of my performances.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d like to go to the theatre more often, but he&#8217;s out of touch, he says, and &#8220;everything gets sold out so far in advance, I can&#8217;t book tickets because I never know where I&#8217;ll be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We meet with the general election looming. Harington says he was &#8220;fiercely socialist&#8221; as a teenager, but which way will he cast his vote? &#8220;My father was traditionally very Conservative and my mother very Labour, so previously I went Lib Dem, but I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ll vote this time. I feel somewhere between Labour, Green and Lib Dems. But I was sympathetic to the way Lib Dems behaved in government; they had to show the country that a coalition could work and stand up to the Tories. Although they did fuck people on tuition fees.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/tv-and-radio/2015/may/03/kit-harington-the-acting-never-feels-like-work-baftas-2015-television#img-4\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430309611761/6a30237f-057d-4782-b3c5-5e36903e90cc-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Kit Harington with Sophie Turner, his sister in Game of Thrones.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x3e%2Fsfb%23img-4&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Kit+Harington%3A+%E2%80%98The+acting+never+feels+like+work%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x3e%2Fstw%23img-4\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Kit+Harington%3A+%E2%80%98The+acting+never+feels+like+work%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftv-and-radio%2F2015%2Fmay%2F03%2Fkit-harington-the-acting-never-feels-like-work-baftas-2015-television&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F29%2F1430309612472%2F6a30237f-057d-4782-b3c5-5e36903e90cc-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nWith Sophie Turner, his sister in Game of Thrones. Photograph: Rex\n\n\n\n<p>He gives a wry grin, one of not many that he allows. His parts have tended to be intense young men with a violent streak &#8211; Will Holloway in Spooks is not a departure. Can he do funny? &#8220;In my private life I like to think so. I&#8217;m not humourless,&#8221; he says, slightly defensively. &#8220;But perhaps it&#8217;s not a side that people see very often.&#8221; To rectify the situation he has made a comedy with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Samberg\" class=\" u-underline\">Andy Samberg</a>, which had its premiere at <a href=\"http://sxsw.co.uk/\" class=\" u-underline\">South by Southwest</a>. &#8220;I play a very stupid English tennis player with an overcontrolling mother,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been in much comedy for a while. You find out very quickly if you can do it or not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His special quality, as far as I can tell, is stillness. The man does not fidget. While he &#8220;snaffles a quick fag&#8221; before we eat, his smoking arm folds at the elbow and straightens unwaveringly back to his side. He twirls the props he is given during the photo shoot with a practised economy of movement, perhaps from five years of handling a sword. He has a melancholic resting face on to which it is hard not to project deep and sensitive feelings. An early director called him the next Brando. Female fans of Game of Thrones have called him all sorts of things, mainly complimentary. It has stood him in good stead as Jon Snow, a character who has grown from a moody adolescent into a troubled but increasingly confident leader. &#8220;I feel like I knew what I was doing with Jon Snow from the start. I love those characters in The Wire or The Sopranos who reveal themselves over several seasons. I have tried to take it slowly; some might say too slowly.&#8221; Another grin.</p>\n<p>For the foreseeable future the role dictates which other jobs he can take, where in the world he&#8217;ll be, and his haircut &#8211; &#8220;about shoulder length&#8221;. One of the reasons he took the Spooks movie is because it fitted with the filming schedule, although he also relished the opportunity to &#8220;run around with a gun&#8221;. Four years since Game of Thrones first aired, Harington is still coming to terms with its implications. He has an older brother, Jack, who lives in Dubai and serves as a point of comparison. &#8220;He used to beat me at go-karting, video games, ping pong, everything,&#8221; Kit says. I suggest that it must have been annoying for Jack when the little brother came up on the inside and became an international celebrity.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/tv-and-radio/2015/may/03/kit-harington-the-acting-never-feels-like-work-baftas-2015-television#img-5\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430309805285/c78f1ff8-f93a-4e9e-a912-dc3daef47ff3-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"As Albert Narracott with Howard Ward (playing Sergeant Thunder) in War Horse at the National Theatre.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x3e%2Fsfb%23img-5&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Kit+Harington%3A+%E2%80%98The+acting+never+feels+like+work%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x3e%2Fstw%23img-5\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Kit+Harington%3A+%E2%80%98The+acting+never+feels+like+work%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftv-and-radio%2F2015%2Fmay%2F03%2Fkit-harington-the-acting-never-feels-like-work-baftas-2015-television&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F29%2F1430309805877%2Fc78f1ff8-f93a-4e9e-a912-dc3daef47ff3-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nAs Albert Narracott with Howard Ward (playing Sergeant Thunder) in War Horse at the National Theatre. Photograph: Simon Annand\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;See, if I may be so bold, a comment like that is what&#8217;s wrong with the world. People think that this, being a famous actor or whatever, is the only achieveable goal in life. Jack doesn&#8217;t give a shit about any of the Thrones stuff. There&#8217;s no amount of money you could pay him to do this.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t the heart to tell him that it was his father who, in all good humour, suggested the &#8220;snuck up on the inside&#8221; line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But it does no good to wonder about what might have been,&#8221; Kit adds. &#8220;This is the path that was given me. Plus, I have a flat &#8211; the Flat That Thrones Bought. I&#8217;m incredibly lucky.&#8221; He&#8217;s in the process of upgrading this to the House That Thrones Bought. Still, he must worry about the Jean-Luc Picard effect, where the first three rows of every Patrick Stewart play are filled with people doing Vulcan salutes. &#8220;As long as they&#8217;re coming to see the play, I&#8217;m happy. And it&#8217;s only the first three rows. Anyway, I accepted that I&#8217;ll most likely be remembered for Jon Snow a long time ago.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Spooks: The Greater Good is out on 8 May</p>\n<p>Follow the Observer Magazine on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/obsmagazine\" class=\" u-underline\">@ObsMagazine</a></p>\n</div>",

Harington says he was \u201cfiercely socialist\u201d as a teenager, but which way will he cast his vote? \u201cMy father was traditionally very Conservative and my mother very Labour, so previously I went Lib Dem, but I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll vote this time. I feel somewhere between Labour, Green and Lib Dems. But I was sympathetic to the way Lib Dems behaved in government; they had to show the country that a coalition could work and stand up to the Tories. Although they did fuck people on tuition fees.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Sophie Turner, his sister in Game of Thrones. Photograph: Rex\n\nHe gives a wry grin, one of not many that he allows. His parts have tended to be intense young men with a violent streak \u2013 Will Holloway in Spooks is not a departure. Can he do funny? \u201cIn my private life I like to think so. I\u2019m not humourless,\u201d he says, slightly defensively. \u201cBut perhaps it\u2019s not a side that people see very often.\u201d To rectify the situation he has made a comedy with Andy Samberg, which had its premiere at South by Southwest. \u201cI play a very stupid English tennis player with an overcontrolling mother,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in much comedy for a while. You find out very quickly if you can do it or not.\u201d\n\nHis special quality, as far as I can tell, is stillness. The man does not fidget. While he \u201csnaffles a quick fag\u201d before we eat, his smoking arm folds at the elbow and straightens unwaveringly back to his side. He twirls the props he is given during the photo shoot with a practised economy of movement, perhaps from five years of handling a sword. He has a melancholic resting face on to which it is hard not to project deep and sensitive feelings. An early director called him the next Brando. Female fans of Game of Thrones have called him all sorts of things, mainly complimentary. It has stood him in good stead as Jon Snow, a character who has grown from a moody adolescent into a troubled but increasingly confident leader. \u201cI feel like I knew what I was doing with Jon Snow from the start. I love those characters in The Wire or The Sopranos who reveal themselves over several seasons. I have tried to take it slowly; some might say too slowly.\u201d Another grin.\n\nFor the foreseeable future the role dictates which other jobs he can take, where in the world he\u2019ll be, and his haircut \u2013 \u201cabout shoulder length\u201d. One of the reasons he took the Spooks movie is because it fitted with the filming schedule, although he also relished the opportunity to \u201crun around with a gun\u201d. Four years since Game of Thrones first aired, Harington is still coming to terms with its implications. He has an older brother, Jack, who lives in Dubai and serves as a point of comparison. \u201cHe used to beat me at go-karting, video games, ping pong, everything,\u201d Kit says. I suggest that it must have been annoying for Jack when the little brother came up on the inside and became an international celebrity.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest As Albert Narracott with Howard Ward (playing Sergeant Thunder) in War Horse at the National Theatre. Photograph: Simon Annand\n\n\u201cSee, if I may be so bold, a comment like that is what\u2019s wrong with the world. People think that this, being a famous actor or whatever, is the only achieveable goal in life. Jack doesn\u2019t give a shit about any of the Thrones stuff. There\u2019s no amount of money you could pay him to do this.\u201d I haven\u2019t the heart to tell him that it was his father who, in all good humour, suggested the \u201csnuck up on the inside\u201d line.\n\n\u201cBut it does no good to wonder about what might have been,\u201d Kit adds. \u201cThis is the path that was given me. Plus, I have a flat \u2013 the Flat That Thrones Bought. I\u2019m incredibly lucky.\u201d He\u2019s in the process of upgrading this to the House That Thrones Bought. Still, he must worry about the Jean-Luc Picard effect, where the first three rows of every Patrick Stewart play are filled with people doing Vulcan salutes. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re coming to see the play, I\u2019m happy. And it\u2019s only the first three rows. Anyway, I accepted that I\u2019ll most likely be remembered for Jon Snow a long time ago.\u201d\n\nSpooks: The Greater Good is out on 8 May\n\nFollow the Observer Magazine on Twitter @ObsMagazine",
