He&#8217;s co-created the BBC&#8217;s most popular drama of the decade, Sherlock, in which he plays Holmes&#8217;s older brother Mycroft. And then there&#8217;s Doctor Who, his first great love, which he has both starred in and written for, but let&#8217;s not forget cult comedy League of Gentlemen that he created more than a decade ago with his Leeds University friends Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton and Jeremy Dyson, and that proved his big break.</p>\n<p>And yet he&#8217;s one of those actors who almost disappears into their roles. He has an everyman quality that, given the right hairstyle or false beard, makes him almost unrecognisable from one programme to the next. It&#8217;s only when I look at his credits that I realise he was behind the big ginger moustache as Major Benjy in the BBC&#8217;s recent remake of Mapp &amp; Lucia.

Photograph: BBC\n\n\n\n<p>The critical and popular success of his and co-creator Steven Moffat&#8217;s version of Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman has been nothing short of astonishing, though he corrects me when I describe it as a &#8220;cult success&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have to take issue with the notion of cults. Sherlock is the biggest drama on the BBC. Its worldwide audience is fucking extraordinary. So it&#8217;s not in any way a cult. We&#8217;ve only made 10 episodes, the 10th of which hasn&#8217;t even been on yet. And most people, of course, just watch it and like it. And then there&#8217;s a very, very dedicated, vocal audience that watches every episode 30 times. That&#8217;s the cult part.&#8221; But then Gatiss can empathise. It was his lifelong fascination with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sherlock\" class=\" u-underline\">Sherlock</a> Holmes that led to the commission, just as it was his obsession with Doctor Who that led the way to his involvement with the 2005 Russell T Davies re-boot.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first love, my last, my everything,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I owe it so much, because in so many ways it&#8217;s what got me interested in acting and writing.&#8221; Growing up, Gatiss had a fascination with horror and the gothic and the slightly macabre. He lived in Sedgefield, County Durham, the youngest of three, and his family home was opposite the Edwardian psychiatric hospital where both of his parents worked. Now he calls this &#8220;the horror of everyday life&#8221;, and in his 20s he wrote several novelisations of Doctor Who which brought him to the attention of Russell T Davies when he was looking for writers for the new series.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/tv-and-radio/2015/may/01/mark-gatiss-doctor-who-is-my-first-love-baftas-2015-television#img-4\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430308066098/f14d4e48-786b-4428-9102-a8a083854edb-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"The League of Gentlemen, created by Mark Gatiss more than a decade ago.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x27%2Fsfb%23img-4&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mark+Gatiss%3A+%E2%80%98Doctor+Who+is+my+first+love%2C+my+last%2C+my+everything%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x27%2Fstw%23img-4\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Mark+Gatiss%3A+%E2%80%98Doctor+Who+is+my+first+love%2C+my+last%2C+my+everything%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftv-and-radio%2F2015%2Fmay%2F01%2Fmark-gatiss-doctor-who-is-my-first-love-baftas-2015-television&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F29%2F1430308067279%2Ff14d4e48-786b-4428-9102-a8a083854edb-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nThe big break: The League of Gentlemen, created by Mark Gatiss more than a decade ago. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I got a call at midnight from a friend of mine saying: &#8216;Are you sitting down?&#8217; And I said: &#8216;No, I&#8217;m lying in bed.&#8217; He told me: &#8216;Doctor Who is coming back.&#8217; And I&#8217;m like: &#8216;What?&#8217;&#8221; A few days later he got a call from Davies and ended up writing an episode set in Victorian Cardiff at a seance held by Charles Dickens. &#8220;It was Christmas 2004. The best present I got.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But then his whole career, at the moment, he says, is &#8220;fulfilling the dreams I had when I was eight.&#8221; Are there any left?</p>\n<p>&#8220;James Bond,&#8221; he says without any doubt, and given his track record, it&#8217;s surely a matter of time before he gets the call. The combination of writing and acting is, he says, a dream scenario. His only frustration is turning down juicy acting gigs for writing commissions and the other way round, though amazingly, despite the success of Sherlock, he doesn&#8217;t always get his passion projects greenlit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It happened very recently.&#8221; And then he goes into a passionate diatribe about &#8220;the forces of darkness who are trying to destroy the BBC&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/tv-and-radio/2015/may/01/mark-gatiss-doctor-who-is-my-first-love-baftas-2015-television#img-5\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430308188570/1b0059f0-f71f-43bc-a805-bc510cdb7ca8-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Gatiss as Peter Mandelson, Ian Grieve as Gordon Brown and Bertie Carvel as Nick Clegg in Coalition.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x27%2Fsfb%23img-5&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mark+Gatiss%3A+%E2%80%98Doctor+Who+is+my+first+love%2C+my+last%2C+my+everything%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x27%2Fstw%23img-5\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Mark+Gatiss%3A+%E2%80%98Doctor+Who+is+my+first+love%2C+my+last%2C+my+everything%E2%80%99&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftv-and-radio%2F2015%2Fmay%2F01%2Fmark-gatiss-doctor-who-is-my-first-love-baftas-2015-television&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F29%2F1430308189109%2F1b0059f0-f71f-43bc-a805-bc510cdb7ca8-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nMark Gatiss as Peter Mandelson, Ian Grieve as Gordon Brown and Bertie Carvel as Nick Clegg in Coalition.

But this is why the licence fee exists. And the BBC is copying these formats from the commercial industry and is at risk of death by 1,000 cutbacks. I just think the argument should be brought to a head with a referendum about the licence fee. &#8216;Do you want this or not?&#8217; And I think 98% of the population would say: &#8216;Of course we do.&#8217; Because for a paltry amount of money, it champions the right to experiment and the right to fail, and to take creative risks. The Daily Mail would cower under a rock. It&#8217;s time the BBC go grow a pair of bollocks and fight back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His outspokenness and impatience perhaps isn&#8217;t a coincidence. In the last couple of years, he lost his mother, his sister and his brother-in-law, and it&#8217;s completely changed his outlook on life. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been terribly lucky in a lot of other things in my life. But it changes everything about you. I feel both more at peace with the world and more impatient. I feel less tolerant of wasting time, but I&#8217;d also rather like to enjoy myself more, let go of things more lightly. I feel dreadfully depressed about the state of the world. I was watching the destruction of the city of Nimrod, on the news last night, and it&#8217;s just so awful. You feel so powerless about the big narrative, so I almost feel beholden to just try and pull the things together and fight for what I can, and just get on with it. We&#8217;re here for such a short time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We are. Though some people pack more in than others. He finishes his coffee, and he&#8217;s off. There&#8217;s a new project to write (&#8220;a film &#8211; something quite different, about a murderer&#8221;) and rehearsals for The Vote to attend. The everyman goes forth.</p>\n<p>Follow the Observer Magazine on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/obsmagazine\" class=\" u-underline\">@ObsMagazine</a></p>\n</div>",

And we\u2019d already talked about his views of the British government being the \u2018dark government\u2019, and it all just slotted into place.\u201d\n\nAs Stephen Gardiner in Wolf Hall. Photograph: BBC\n\nThe critical and popular success of his and co-creator Steven Moffat\u2019s version of Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman has been nothing short of astonishing, though he corrects me when I describe it as a \u201ccult success\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have to take issue with the notion of cults. Sherlock is the biggest drama on the BBC. Its worldwide audience is fucking extraordinary. So it\u2019s not in any way a cult. We\u2019ve only made 10 episodes, the 10th of which hasn\u2019t even been on yet. And most people, of course, just watch it and like it. And then there\u2019s a very, very dedicated, vocal audience that watches every episode 30 times. That\u2019s the cult part.\u201d But then Gatiss can empathise. It was his lifelong fascination with Sherlock Holmes that led to the commission, just as it was his obsession with Doctor Who that led the way to his involvement with the 2005 Russell T Davies re-boot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first love, my last, my everything,\u201d he says. \u201cI owe it so much, because in so many ways it\u2019s what got me interested in acting and writing.\u201d Growing up, Gatiss had a fascination with horror and the gothic and the slightly macabre. He lived in Sedgefield, County Durham, the youngest of three, and his family home was opposite the Edwardian psychiatric hospital where both of his parents worked. Now he calls this \u201cthe horror of everyday life\u201d, and in his 20s he wrote several novelisations of Doctor Who which brought him to the attention of Russell T Davies when he was looking for writers for the new series.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The big break: The League of Gentlemen, created by Mark Gatiss more than a decade ago. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex\n\n\u201cI got a call at midnight from a friend of mine saying: \u2018Are you sitting down?\u2019 And I said: \u2018No, I\u2019m lying in bed.\u2019 He told me: \u2018Doctor Who is coming back.\u2019 And I\u2019m like: \u2018What?\u2019\u201d A few days later he got a call from Davies and ended up writing an episode set in Victorian Cardiff at a seance held by Charles Dickens. \u201cIt was Christmas 2004. The best present I got.\u201d\n\nBut then his whole career, at the moment, he says, is \u201cfulfilling the dreams I had when I was eight.\u201d Are there any left?\n\n\u201cJames Bond,\u201d he says without any doubt, and given his track record, it\u2019s surely a matter of time before he gets the call. The combination of writing and acting is, he says, a dream scenario. His only frustration is turning down juicy acting gigs for writing commissions and the other way round, though amazingly, despite the success of Sherlock, he doesn\u2019t always get his passion projects greenlit.\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d he says. \u201cIt happened very recently.\u201d And then he goes into a passionate diatribe about \u201cthe forces of darkness who are trying to destroy the BBC\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Gatiss as Peter Mandelson, Ian Grieve as Gordon Brown and Bertie Carvel as Nick Clegg in Coalition. Photograph: Rory Mulvey/Channel 4\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t bear the ratings obsession. It\u2019s the first line of every email. It\u2019s the first thing you hear. But this is why the licence fee exists. And the BBC is copying these formats from the commercial industry and is at risk of death by 1,000 cutbacks. I just think the argument should be brought to a head with a referendum about the licence fee. \u2018Do you want this or not?\u2019 And I think 98% of the population would say: \u2018Of course we do.\u2019 Because for a paltry amount of money, it champions the right to experiment and the right to fail, and to take creative risks. The Daily Mail would cower under a rock. It\u2019s time the BBC go grow a pair of bollocks and fight back.\u201d\n\nHis outspokenness and impatience perhaps isn\u2019t a coincidence. In the last couple of years, he lost his mother, his sister and his brother-in-law, and it\u2019s completely changed his outlook on life. \u201cI\u2019ve been terribly lucky in a lot of other things in my life. But it changes everything about you. I feel both more at peace with the world and more impatient. I feel less tolerant of wasting time, but I\u2019d also rather like to enjoy myself more, let go of things more lightly. I feel dreadfully depressed about the state of the world. I was watching the destruction of the city of Nimrod, on the news last night, and it\u2019s just so awful. You feel so powerless about the big narrative, so I almost feel beholden to just try and pull the things together and fight for what I can, and just get on with it. We\u2019re here for such a short time.\u201d\n\nWe are. Though some people pack more in than others. He finishes his coffee, and he\u2019s off. There\u2019s a new project to write (\u201ca film \u2013 something quite different, about a murderer\u201d) and rehearsals for The Vote to attend. The everyman goes forth.\n\nFollow the Observer Magazine on Twitter @ObsMagazine",
