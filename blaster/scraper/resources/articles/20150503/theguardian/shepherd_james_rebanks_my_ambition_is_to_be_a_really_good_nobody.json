But don&#8217;t your book&#8217;s sales figures prove you wrong?</strong><br>I have been surprised that there is a massive desire to understand farming better &#8211; and I think tourists suspect now that they are not getting the full story. I must admit it has partly been farmers&#8217; fault &#8211; we&#8217;ve not shared our story enough, we didn&#8217;t see how important it was to share it.</p>\n<p><strong>You have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/herdyshepherd1\" class=\" u-underline\">60,000 followers on Twitter</a>. Do you tweet and herd simultaneously? And why does your life appeal to your followers so much?</strong><br>I never tweet when I have something else on. I do it like a diary, like thoughts in my head and don&#8217;t think of it as being for anyone. I am then surprised when people know about my life. But that&#8217;s why it works. If it appeals it is because people have heard nothing but negative stuff about farming for 20 years and become mistrustful. They like the idea farming is not all industrial, that there is resistance, defiance, the message: I&#8217;m not changing.</p>\n<p><strong>What qualities should a shepherd have?</strong><br>You have to be intelligent, stubborn, stoical. You need stickability &#8211; you have to endure. You need to be observant. To be a better shepherd, I need to stop doing other things &#8211; like writing books! My father died at the end of February and I&#8217;m not such a tough fella as my dad. He was not a talker but taught by example. He worked hard and modestly. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does leading the life of your forebears matter?</strong><br>I&#8217;ve looked at the world and thought about what a good society looks like. The more I&#8217;ve travelled [he has worked for Unesco to support his farming financially], the more I&#8217;ve come to Wordsworth&#8217;s conclusion that there is something fundamentally good about people working on the land and in what he called the &#8220;perfect republic of shepherds&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>And you are passing this on to the next generation: has your three-year-old son, Isaac, got a sheepdog yet?</strong><br>He has just claimed Meg &#8211; from our recent litter of puppies.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you describe the bond that forms between you and a sheepdog?</strong><br>Last night, I was &#8211; excuse my French &#8211; knackered, I had to go lambing. I told my wife, Helen, I hoped nothing would be going on but seven lambs were born in the next hour and one got stuck. Without the dogs&#8217; help, it was going to die&#8230; I could have run all night after [the sheep that was having difficulty giving birth] at 15mph but would never have rescued it. I drive a quad bike but that will only get you to the field, it is the dog that will help catch the sheep.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"js-tweet tweet\">\n<p class=\"tweet-user\">&#8212; Herdwick Shepherd (@herdyshepherd1)</p>\n \n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tweet-body\">Twins <a href=\"https://t.co/TjhBx7yQik\" class=\" u-underline\">https://t.co/TjhBx7yQik</a></p>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/herdyshepherd1/status/593676051240394752\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>You left school at 15 but got into Oxford in your 20s and left with a first in history.
