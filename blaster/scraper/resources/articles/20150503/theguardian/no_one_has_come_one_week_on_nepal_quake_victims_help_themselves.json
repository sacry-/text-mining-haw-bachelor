The initial chaos and fear had given way to grief and anxiety. The men, women and children of the small community high in the hills 50 miles northeast of Kathmandu wrapped the seven bodies in makeshift shrouds and carried them down through terraced fields and woods to the fast-flowing river.</p>\n<p>There the remains of the four children, all very small, and three adults were cremated according to traditional Hindu rites. Then the 500 villagers walked back up the steep slope to their homes, or what was left of them. Almost all the 83 houses lay in ruins.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, a week to the hour after the 7.9 magnitude earthquake that has killed at least 6,900 in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nepal\" class=\" u-underline\">Nepal</a>, injured 15,000 and made up to half a million homeless, many of the villagers of Swarathok were sitting under the jackfruit tree in its centre. They have received almost no aid so far and have not been visited by a single government official. On Tuesday, Rashmita Shashtra, a 23-year-old public health student in Swarathok, had told the Observer: &#8220;No one has come.&#8221; On Saturday she laughed grimly: &#8220;Still no one has come.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The images of Nepal last week have shown a desperately poor nation, overwhelmed by an immense disaster. The only consolation &#8211; a bitter one indeed &#8211; is that it could have been worse. This &#8220;Great Quake&#8221;, as local media have dubbed it, is not the Big One that the same newspapers have long predicted. Kathmandu, a city of 3 million, has expanded exponentially in recent years, with acre after acre of farmland covered by poor-quality cement tenements. These stayed up, as they did even in distant district centres close to the epicentre, like Gorkha Bazaar. This, and the fact that the quake came at 11.41am on a Saturday when rural people were in the fields and schools were shut, meant the death toll, tragic though it is, was a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of casualties feared.</p>\n<p>But what the pictures have also shown is a government entirely unable to help its citizens. The villagers of Swarathok are an example of how unfair this is. After the funerals on Monday, the 83 householders started organising. Shashtra, the health student, dug a notebook out of the rubble and made a list of survivors. She convinced them to pool scant food stocks they had salvaged from their wrecked home, worked out how much each household could have each day, and distributed vital remaining kitchen utensils. &#8220;It is the duty of the government to do this, of course, but when I went to the police they said &#8216;just stay where you are&#8217;. We did not just want to wait and see. So we started acting ourselves. The most important thing is to be united,&#8221; Shashtra said.</p>\n<p>Unity is not a quality many associate with Nepal. The stunningly beautiful Himalayan country is chiefly known overseas for being home to Everest, the world&#8217;s highest peak. The vast proportion of international media attention has long focused on the peak, or western holidaymakers walking the famous routes such as the Annapurna circuit. Interest in the country spikes when there is a disaster, and there are many.

It has a history of conflict to rival many sub-Saharan African states, and a cultural heritage that is one of the richest in the world.</p>\n<p>The former kingdom was plunged into a vicious 10-war civil war waged by Maoist revolutionaries against the government and security forces in 1995. Around 18,000 died.
