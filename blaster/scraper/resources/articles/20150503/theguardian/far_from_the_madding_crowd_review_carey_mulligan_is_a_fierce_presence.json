There is an outstanding supporting turn from Michael Sheen as Mr Boldwood, the neighbouring landowner who is to become tragically and self-laceratingly infatuated with Bathsheba, after she sends him an insincere Valentine card. As the conceited Sergeant Troy, Tom Sturridge looks the part without conveying his febrile, egocentric quality &#8211; although the role is arguably underwritten, and Troy&#8217;s big fairground scene is cut. And the part of the devoted shepherd Gabriel Oak has mystifyingly been given to the Belgian star Matthias Schoenaerts, who is uncomfortable in an English-language role.
