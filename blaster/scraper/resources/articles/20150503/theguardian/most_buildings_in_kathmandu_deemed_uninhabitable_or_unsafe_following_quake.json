Hundreds of villages in parts of Gorkha and Sindhulpalchowk districts, two of the worst hit, have been entirely destroyed.</p>\n<p> The pace of aid distribution in remote zones, where hundreds of thousands of people are homeless, is beginning to accelerate after widespread criticism of the Nepalese government for a slow and ineffective early response.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have hardly met 20% of the demand of the people.
