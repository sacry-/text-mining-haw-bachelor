Ben Rosen, the former chairman of Compaq, said Fiorina &#8220;simply did not have the skills to manage one of the world&#8217;s largest technology companies&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Under Fiorina, HP revenue more than doubled &#8211; from $42bn in sales to $87bn &#8211; but net earnings fell to $2.4bn from $3.1bn. </p>\n<p>The Unlocking Potential Project, Fiorina&#8217;s new initiative to help close the gender gap and recruit more independent women backers, <a href=\"https://www.up-project.org/leadership.php\" class=\" u-underline\">describes her achievements</a> at HP as including &#8220;market leadership in every market and product category and quadruple cash-flow&#8221;. But HP stock tumbled 50% during her tenure &#8211; and leaped 6.9% the day after her departure.</p>\n<p>Burnett, the Packard grandson, said those financial realities create a dilemma for an ardent advocate of a free market advocate: &#8220;What can she say? The market was mistaken?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Five years after the ouster, when Fiorina began her first bid for public office and challenged Barbara Boxer for her California senate seat, his sister Arianna wrote a letter. Fiorina, the heiress warned three Republican senators who had endorsed the former CEO, was spinning her record at HP &#8211; and accused her of using the golden parachute for &#8220;financing her campaign&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[A]llow me to disillusion you of a few of your stated reasons for supporting her,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34086.html\" class=\" u-underline\">Packard wrote</a>. &#8220;Most business commentators consider Fiorina&#8217;s tenure at HP to be a disaster.&#8221;</p>\n<p> Boxer defeated Fiorina resoundingly, thanks in large part to devastating attack ads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"embed-video-wrapper u-responsive-ratio u-responsive-ratio--hd\">\n\n</p>\n\n<p>One intoned: &#8220;As CEO of HP, Carly Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers.

But an Associated Press poll released over the weekend suggests she may have many deals yet to make: just 7% of those surveyed had a favourable view of Fiorina, and a full three-quarters said they did not know enough about her.\n\n\u201cPeople out there are not troubled by the fact I have not held elected office,\u201d Fiorina told a conservative audience in Washington on Saturday.\n\nA \u2018disaster\u2019 at HP looming on the campaign trail\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fiorina at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2005, one month before she was ousted by the board of Hewlett-Packard. Photograph: Mike Blake/Reutuers\n\nEven if Fiorina\u2019s presidential run ends as a way to the vice-presidency, campaign-watchers say her six years at HP will shape voter perceptions: \u201cAnd not to her advantage,\u201d said Melinda Jackson, a politics professor at San Jose state university. \u201cIt was a rocky tenure. I think it will haunt her.\u201d\n\nCritics recall that HP\u2019s board accused her of \u201cdestroying\u201d the company\u2019s value by mishandling the Compaq takeover, a move that committed HP to making low-margin personal computers rather than focusing on higher-margin products such as printers.\n\nThe company was sued by its shareholders, who argued she didn\u2019t deserve such a massive severance package. Ben Rosen, the former chairman of Compaq, said Fiorina \u201csimply did not have the skills to manage one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies\u201d.\n\nUnder Fiorina, HP revenue more than doubled \u2013 from $42bn in sales to $87bn \u2013 but net earnings fell to $2.4bn from $3.1bn.\n\nThe Unlocking Potential Project, Fiorina\u2019s new initiative to help close the gender gap and recruit more independent women backers, describes her achievements at HP as including \u201cmarket leadership in every market and product category and quadruple cash-flow\u201d. But HP stock tumbled 50% during her tenure \u2013 and leaped 6.9% the day after her departure.\n\nBurnett, the Packard grandson, said those financial realities create a dilemma for an ardent advocate of a free market advocate: \u201cWhat can she say? The market was mistaken?\u201d\n\nFive years after the ouster, when Fiorina began her first bid for public office and challenged Barbara Boxer for her California senate seat, his sister Arianna wrote a letter. Fiorina, the heiress warned three Republican senators who had endorsed the former CEO, was spinning her record at HP \u2013 and accused her of using the golden parachute for \u201cfinancing her campaign\u201d.\n\n\u201c[A]llow me to disillusion you of a few of your stated reasons for supporting her,\u201d Packard wrote. \u201cMost business commentators consider Fiorina\u2019s tenure at HP to be a disaster.\u201d\n\nBoxer defeated Fiorina resoundingly, thanks in large part to devastating attack ads.\n\nOne intoned: \u201cAs CEO of HP, Carly Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers. Fiorina shipped jobs to China. And while Californians lost their jobs, Fiorina tripled her salary, bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets ... Carly Fiorina. Outsourcing jobs. Out for herself.\u201d\n\nRepublican rivals for the 2016 nominating fight may borrow that playbook from 2010, said Bill Whalen, a Hoover Institution research fellow who advises California\u2019s top Republicans.\n\n\u201cI can see a Super Pac doing the same to her in the primary,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cHers is not an easy story to tell.\u201d\n\nEscaping \u2018haters\u2019 and courting startup dollars\n\nAfter spending last week in New Hampshire, Fiorina will roll out her candidacy via social media on Monday, followed by media interviews, a campaign booklet called \u201cMy Leadership Journey\u201d and an address to the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York, where she will seek to regain confidence from a startup world she left behind on the wrong side of a bubble.\n\nBut her bid for the White House is already being cast by many politicos as a bid for redemption, to banish the ignominy from her HP departure. Activists and donors are watching closely to see if she can still lure campaign financing out of a \u201cCarly for America\u201d fundraising operation already drawing scrutiny from federal officials.\n\n\u201cI was in junior high, I don\u2019t know what happened at HP,\u201d said Aaron Ginn, the co-founder of San Francisco-based Lincoln Labs, a lobbying group that enlists an increasingly influential \u2013 and rich \u2013 group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs wading into the world of donations with politics that are a blend of socially open-minded libertarianism and new-school Republicanism.\n\nSpeaking in a personal capacity, and without endorsing any candidate, Ginn said he liked Fiorina\u2019s conviction and philosophical underpinnings. He shrugged off the attacks on her as standard electoral fare: \u201cYou can find a hater anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Carly Fiorina will lose the Republican nomination to prove there's no war on women\n\nBut as the Clintons discovered with Whitewater and now everything from email servers to charitable donations, US presidential campaigns can shine harsh, sustained spotlights on old events. Just ask John Kerry about that swift boat and the Vietnam war.\n\nTo Fiorina\u2019s admirers, they see presidential attributes in the tenacity and confidence of an executive willing to confront the future \u2013 if not quite all of her past.\n\nHer \u201cincredibly smart, passionate, articulate\u201d qualities shined some years ago, said Carl Guardino, a former HP executive who is now CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, when she accepted his invitation to address an audience of mostly underprivileged Latina girls.\n\n\u201cShe was mesmerising,\u201d Guardino said.\n\nVerley, the former communications director at HP, said Fiorina\u2019s self-confidence may have led to boardroom fiasco and that historical \u201cfantasy\u201d may yet help Fiorina make an impact on the most crowded Republican field in years \u2013 and be a thorn in Clinton\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a born politician,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s extremely confident of her ability to step into any situation and command it.\u201d",
