According to US Census figures, more than 20 million people, or 6% of the population, live in trailer parks.</p>\n<p>It is a market that has not been lost on some of the country&#8217;s richest and most high-profile investors. Sam Zell&#8217;s Equity LifeStyle Properties (ELS) is the largest mobile home park owner in America, with controlling interests in nearly 140,000 parks.

So stay together as a herd.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p>He&#8217;s not wrong. Signs at the entrance to <a href=\"http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/the-scarlet-letter/Content?oid=2256113\" class=\" u-underline\">Lake Shore Village</a>, on the north-eastern outskirts of Orlando, warn: &#8220;Adults only. No Children.&#8221; The park is described on the owner&#8217;s business cards as &#8220;sex offender housing&#8221; and a &#8220;habitat for offenders&#8221;.<br></p>\n<p>On the forecourt <a href=\"http://sohofl.org/\" class=\" u-underline\">the owner, Lori Lee</a>, tells Rolfe&#8217;s students she dedicated the park to sex offenders 20 years ago &#8211; and hasn&#8217;t looked back. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We were a family park when we first started. [But] about 20 years ago, I couldn&#8217;t get on the property because a drug dealer had separated from his girlfriend in the park across the street ... and there was a long line of cars because she was undercutting her boyfriend.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p>Lee, 70, says she was advised that if she took in sex offenders the drug dealers would leave. &#8220;So, I started taking in sex offenders, and I have a very clean property. Sex offenders are watched by the news media, the TV, the sheriff&#8217;s department, probation, the department of corrections ... so when they are in there, the drug dealers and the other people don&#8217;t like to be around.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p>Sex offenders have been good for Lee financially, with park occupancy running at &#8220;1,000%&#8221;. She rents trailer pad spots for about $325 a month. The trailers are either owned by the tenant or rented from a third party. Many trailers are divided into three bedrooms, for which tenants are charged $500 a month per room.<br></p>\n<p>Lee claims she was once offered $5m for Lake Shore Park, which is home to about 50 trailers.<br></p>\n<p>&#8220;Last year I bought a park down the street, got rid of all the families, the drug dealers, the prostitutes, and brought in convicted felons. And then I bought the property across the way,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Once you&#8217;re into it and you&#8217;re making money it&#8217;s easy to say, &#8216;One more, one more&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She has her eyes on a fourth park, &#8220;but then I&#8217;m through. I&#8217;m 70 years old and I don&#8217;t want to own any more&#8221;.<br></p>\n<p>Asked by an eager investor how regularly tenants leave her parks, Lee says: &#8220;When they die. [They] stay forever, they have no place to go.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p>Lee&#8217;s strategy impresses Rolfe&#8217;s students. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought it was a brilliant idea, brilliant,&#8221; says Mitch Huhem, who is looking to buy a trailer park with his wife, Deborah. &#8220;These people need a place to live, and they don&#8217;t want to mess around.<br></p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to live somewhere, so you combine them in a certain place. They don&#8217;t go out to hurt people. I think it&#8217;s a community service, because if not they will be in your neighbourhood. Now they&#8217;re all in one place, you can watch them all in one place. And they pay well and won&#8217;t mess things up. I mean, why would you not? I think it&#8217;s a brilliant idea.&#8221;<br></p>\n<h2>&#8216;The rents do not go down&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n<a href=\"/lifeandstyle/2015/may/03/owning-trailer-parks-mobile-home-university-investment#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/2/1430600818175/59142cbf-b217-4779-a212-52bbae841dee-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"trailer park\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483d6%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=America%27s+trailer+parks%3A+the+residents+may+be+poor+but+the+owners+are+getting+rich&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F483d6%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=America%27s+trailer+parks%3A+the+residents+may+be+poor+but+the+owners+are+getting+rich&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Flifeandstyle%2F2015%2Fmay%2F03%2Fowning-trailer-parks-mobile-home-university-investment&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F2%2F1430600818730%2F90d55f75-30ec-48d0-b033-f206dd033d09-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nDavid Santana and his family recently moved into a more upmarket Orlando trailer park after giving up on their dream of ever owning their own bricks and mortar home. &#8220;We ran into the community and talked to the property manager, and when we talked to him we fell in love with the place,&#8221; he says. Photograph: Mae Ryan/the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>Rolfe, who with his business partner Dave Reynolds owns about 160 parks across the midwest, is unsure about taking in sex offenders. But he is certain Lee could make even more money if she raised the rent.<br></p>\n<p>&#8220;She could definitely raise the rent,&#8221; he says, as the tour group gets back on the bus. &#8220;She&#8217;s got a definite niche, but she is definitely under the Orlando rent; she might be under by $100 a month, maybe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Raising the rent is typically part of the day one purchase, because often the &#8216;mom and pop&#8217; [previous, family-run owner of a park] has not raised the rent in years so it&#8217;s far below market. </p>\n<p>&#8220;[The rents] do not go down, that&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s a safe bet in the trailer park world. Our rents do not go down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We traditionally raise our rents by an average of 10% a year or something like that, and it&#8217;s pretty much true for the industry. Our world record [rent increase] went from $125 to $275 in one month.&#8221;<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Raising the rent is typically part of the day one purchase, because often the 'mom and pop' has not raised rent in years</p>\n\nFrank Rolfe\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rolfe, who bought a pistol for personal security when he bought his first park, 20 years ago, says he sent a letter to every tenant at that park in Grapevine, Texas, telling them the rent was going to more than double but was still below the market rate of $325.<br></p>\n<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like this or you think you can do better, here&#8217;s a list of all the other parks in Grapevine and a list of the owners,&#8221; he said in the letter. &#8220;Go ahead, call them if you want to move. How many customers do you think we lost? Zero. Where were they going to go?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rolfe, who started Mobile Home University seven years ago and now runs boot camps every couple months in cities across the country, tells his students they can easily increase the rent even at parks that are already charging market rates, because there is so much demand for affordable housing and local authorities are very reluctant to grant permission for new parks.<br></p>\n<p>He quotes <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2013\" class=\" u-underline\">US government statistics</a> showing that in 2013, 39% of Americans earned less than $20,000 &#8211; less than the government&#8217;s <a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/15poverty.cfm\" class=\" u-underline\">poverty threshold income</a> of $20,090 for a three-person household. </p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s huge. No one believes that number &#8211; people say: &#8216;You&#8217;re crazy, this is America, everyone is rich.&#8217; [Being on an income of $20,000 or less] means you have a budget of about $500 a month for your housing, but the average two-bedroom apartment is $1,109 a month. There&#8217;s not a lot you can do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kenneth Staton, a 58-year-old, disabled tenant at a nearby (non-sex offender) trailer park, knows it. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a profitable investment, but raising the rent is what hurts because people like myself, we&#8217;re on a fixed income and we can only afford so much,&#8221; he says, on the dirt road outside his trailer. &#8220;I&#8217;m on disability, and I go around and collect aluminium cans to see myself through a little bit.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p>Asked if he thinks he will see out his days in the trailer park, Staton says: &#8220;It kinda looks like it, unless I can find a house somewhere I can afford. I only get $830 a month; $500 goes for rent, about $95 goes for electric. It don&#8217;t leave much to live on.

Sex offenders are watched by the news media, the TV, the sheriff\u2019s department, probation, the department of corrections ... so when they are in there, the drug dealers and the other people don\u2019t like to be around.\u201d\n\n\n\nSex offenders have been good for Lee financially, with park occupancy running at \u201c1,000%\u201d. She rents trailer pad spots for about $325 a month. The trailers are either owned by the tenant or rented from a third party. Many trailers are divided into three bedrooms, for which tenants are charged $500 a month per room.\n\n\n\nLee claims she was once offered $5m for Lake Shore Park, which is home to about 50 trailers.\n\n\n\n\u201cLast year I bought a park down the street, got rid of all the families, the drug dealers, the prostitutes, and brought in convicted felons. And then I bought the property across the way,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce you\u2019re into it and you\u2019re making money it\u2019s easy to say, \u2018One more, one more\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe has her eyes on a fourth park, \u201cbut then I\u2019m through. I\u2019m 70 years old and I don\u2019t want to own any more\u201d.\n\n\n\nAsked by an eager investor how regularly tenants leave her parks, Lee says: \u201cWhen they die. [They] stay forever, they have no place to go.\u201d\n\n\n\nLee\u2019s strategy impresses Rolfe\u2019s students.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a brilliant idea, brilliant,\u201d says Mitch Huhem, who is looking to buy a trailer park with his wife, Deborah. \u201cThese people need a place to live, and they don\u2019t want to mess around.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to live somewhere, so you combine them in a certain place. They don\u2019t go out to hurt people. I think it\u2019s a community service, because if not they will be in your neighbourhood. Now they\u2019re all in one place, you can watch them all in one place. And they pay well and won\u2019t mess things up. I mean, why would you not? I think it\u2019s a brilliant idea.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018The rents do not go down\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Santana and his family recently moved into a more upmarket Orlando trailer park after giving up on their dream of ever owning their own bricks and mortar home. \u201cWe ran into the community and talked to the property manager, and when we talked to him we fell in love with the place,\u201d he says. Photograph: Mae Ryan/the Guardian\n\nRolfe, who with his business partner Dave Reynolds owns about 160 parks across the midwest, is unsure about taking in sex offenders. But he is certain Lee could make even more money if she raised the rent.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe could definitely raise the rent,\u201d he says, as the tour group gets back on the bus. \u201cShe\u2019s got a definite niche, but she is definitely under the Orlando rent; she might be under by $100 a month, maybe.\n\n\u201cRaising the rent is typically part of the day one purchase, because often the \u2018mom and pop\u2019 [previous, family-run owner of a park] has not raised the rent in years so it\u2019s far below market.\n\n\u201c[The rents] do not go down, that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s a safe bet in the trailer park world. Our rents do not go down.\n\n\u201cWe traditionally raise our rents by an average of 10% a year or something like that, and it\u2019s pretty much true for the industry. Our world record [rent increase] went from $125 to $275 in one month.\u201d\n\n\n\nRaising the rent is typically part of the day one purchase, because often the 'mom and pop' has not raised rent in years Frank Rolfe\n\nRolfe, who bought a pistol for personal security when he bought his first park, 20 years ago, says he sent a letter to every tenant at that park in Grapevine, Texas, telling them the rent was going to more than double but was still below the market rate of $325.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like this or you think you can do better, here\u2019s a list of all the other parks in Grapevine and a list of the owners,\u201d he said in the letter. \u201cGo ahead, call them if you want to move. How many customers do you think we lost? Zero. Where were they going to go?\u201d\n\nRolfe, who started Mobile Home University seven years ago and now runs boot camps every couple months in cities across the country, tells his students they can easily increase the rent even at parks that are already charging market rates, because there is so much demand for affordable housing and local authorities are very reluctant to grant permission for new parks.\n\n\n\nHe quotes US government statistics showing that in 2013, 39% of Americans earned less than $20,000 \u2013 less than the government\u2019s poverty threshold income of $20,090 for a three-person household.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s huge. No one believes that number \u2013 people say: \u2018You\u2019re crazy, this is America, everyone is rich.\u2019 [Being on an income of $20,000 or less] means you have a budget of about $500 a month for your housing, but the average two-bedroom apartment is $1,109 a month. There\u2019s not a lot you can do.\u201d\n\nKenneth Staton, a 58-year-old, disabled tenant at a nearby (non-sex offender) trailer park, knows it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a profitable investment, but raising the rent is what hurts because people like myself, we\u2019re on a fixed income and we can only afford so much,\u201d he says, on the dirt road outside his trailer. \u201cI\u2019m on disability, and I go around and collect aluminium cans to see myself through a little bit.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked if he thinks he will see out his days in the trailer park, Staton says: \u201cIt kinda looks like it, unless I can find a house somewhere I can afford. I only get $830 a month; $500 goes for rent, about $95 goes for electric. It don\u2019t leave much to live on. Luckily, I get food stamps.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018There\u2019s more poor people every day\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Santana\u2019s children, and their friends, say they much prefer playing in the trailer park to playing in the apartment they used to live in three blocks over. Currently more than 20m people, or 6% of the population, live in trailer parks, according to US census figures. Photograph: Mae Ryan/the Guardian\n\nBack at the boot camp, Rolfe, who runs his empire from the tiny town of Cedaredge, Colorado, is in full swing.\n\n\u201cToday there\u2019s a huge number of poor people, and there\u2019s more poor people like every day,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of our parks get 100 calls a week from people that are looking for a mobile home to rent.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe tells his students tenants are more likely to be encouraged to put in a few more hours at Walmart or other low-paying jobs than find the $3,000-$5,000 it costs to move their trailer \u2013 the majority of tenants own their trailers and rent the pad space beneath \u2013 to another park.\n\n\n\nThe students are sold on the idea. Thomas Hawcett, a navy veteran from Long Island, vows not to go home until he\u2019s found a park to buy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first park I\u2019m going to look at is a 279-pad park,\u201d he says, over a \u201cteam dinner\u201d at Orlando\u2019s Bonefish Grill. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you where. I\u2019ll spend a week, and if I have to spend another week I\u2019ll spend another week. I brought enough money that I can write a cheque and give a good deposit if I see one.\u201d\n\nTaylor Boyd, who already owns a trailer park but has yet to step inside a trailer, says the economics of trailer parks are \u201ccompelling\u201d.\n\nWhat's that thing? 'Sell to the masses, eat with the classes.' There's a lot more poor people than there are rich people Taylor Boyd\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that thing? \u2018Sell to the masses and eat with the classes\u2019,\u201d he says, touting the inside of a dilapidated and mould-infested trailer in Overland Village, another Orlando trailer park owned by Lee. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more poor people than there are rich people, and they\u2019re not making any more trailer parks.\u201d\n\n\n\nIs he planning to follow Rolfe\u2019s advice and raise the rent? \u201cIf you\u2019re a landlord, you\u2019re going to raise the rent, but you\u2019ve got to keep it low enough for the people to be able to afford to be there.\u201d\n\n\n\nA few trailers over, Chuck Newton is sitting on the steps of his trailer, shooting the breeze with some friends as Boyd and the other students excitedly explore the park and plan their burgeoning business ideas.\n\n\n\nIf the investors were to buy this park and put up his rent, Newton, who collects disability payments of $700 a month and pays $550 a month in rent, fears he would be forced on to the street.\n\n\u201cI would have to find another low-rent place to move to,\u201d he says. \u201cI would probably end up having to be homeless.\u201d\n\n",
