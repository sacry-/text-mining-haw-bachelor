Photograph: Jonathan Gorvett\n\n\n\n<p> The survey, undertaken late last year by Nicosia-based cross-community organisation SeeD, showed that since Cyprus experienced an economic crisis in 2013, feelings of estrangement between the communities have increased.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The economic crisis has been very negative,&#8221; says Natasha Apostolidou of SeeD. &#8220;Some Turkish Cypriots who used to work for Greek Cypriots lost their jobs and also their access to health benefits. So we found more Turkish Cypriots not wanting to work for Greek Cypriots and more Greek Cypriots seeing Turkish Cypriots as a threat to their jobs and economic security.&#8221;</p>\n<p> At the same time, years without a settlement are leading many &#8211; particularly the young &#8211; to despair of any future reconciliation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of younger people on both sides don&#8217;t even know what someone on the other side looks like,&#8221; says 19-year-old Panos Christoforidis, whose grandparents were among those who fled Varosha. &#8220;They think they are axe-wielding barbarians. I&#8217;ll be honest, I don&#8217;t have much hope after all these years, particularly given our useless politicians.&#8221;</p>\n<p> Yet such discouraging views do not put off activists such as Shirin Jetha, a director of the Association for Historical Dialogue and Research (AHDR), which is trying to change the way history and social sciences are taught to the island&#8217;s young people.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can&#8217;t let this chain of bad feeling go on from one generation to another &#8211; you have to stop it somewhere</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#8220;If the politicians aren&#8217;t laying the ground work,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and people are feeling that there is no move for reconciliation from them, then things like the SeeD survey are no surprise. It just means we have to put in even more effort to bring people together.&#8221;</p>\n<p> Mertkan Hamit of the Famagusta Initiative agrees. &#8220;For years, the politicians have been talking, but at that level nothing has been happening. So, we have to get away from this obsolete idea of the two leaders meeting and deciding everything. The ordinary people have to be more involved if there is ever going to be a solution.&#8221;</p>\n<p> For 17-year-old basketball player Christiana Miltiadous, that contact between ordinary people is crucial. &#8220;At school, they taught us the Turkish Cypriots were all bad people. None of us had even met any, but of course, when you do meet them, it&#8217;s not like that at all, it&#8217;s a wonderful surprise. I know some Greek Cypriots don&#8217;t like Turks, but you can&#8217;t let this chain of bad feeling go on from one generation to another &#8211; you have to stop it somewhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For some, the election of Akinci, known for his commitment to reuniting the island, is the first hopeful sign in a long while that that chain may at least now be loosening. &#8220;I think for the first time, Greek Cypriots travelled to the North to celebrate with the Turkish Cypriots,&#8221; says Hamit.</p>\n<p> Back on the beach at Famagusta, thought, Hadjidemetriou and her friends have finished decorating the float.
