Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>O&#8217;Dwyer, meanwhile, lives in the parliamentary constituency of Brent Central, represented by the Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather.<strong> </strong>At the 2006 local council elections O&#8217;Dwyer&#8217;s ward of Mapesbury &#8211; which had been a Labour-Conservative marginal &#8211; elected three Lib Dem councillors, all of whom survived the 2010 elections. In the council elections of 2014, Labour took back two of the seats.</p>\n<p>Not all of O&#8217;Dwyer&#8217;s and Bigg&#8217;s contemporaries, however, will take up their opportunity to vote on 7 May. Of the 3.3 million young people able to cast their ballot for the first time, just 41% will take part in the election, according to a <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/redbox/\" class=\" u-underline\">Red Box analysis</a> of YouGov voter-intention data, electoral register figures and birth rates. An estimated 2 million young people will not vote at all. </p>\n<p>Among the first-time voters who will use their voice, however, Labour has a slight edge over the Conservatives, with 35% support, compared with 30%. First-time voter support for the Conservatives has, however, increased from 22% in the last general election, with the party looking likely to win 285,000 young voters in May.</p>\n<p>The analysis also suggested that the Lib Dems will lose the support of a swath of young voters, with just 9.4% saying they will vote for the party, compared with 14.4% favouring the Greens and 7.9% giving their support to Ukip. </p>\n<p>If a<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/redbox/topic/young-voters/labour-wins-over-most-first-time-voters\" class=\" u-underline\"> mock election last month at Croydon College, in south-east London, </a>is indicative of the general attitude among first-time voters, however, then substantial numbers of young people are already too disillusioned with politics to use their vote. Just 38% of the 8,000 students in the mock election said they intended to vote in the real event. Almost 40% said they had no interest in taking part, with many saying they could not see the point because they &#8220;did not trust any of the parties&#8221;.</p>\n<p>It is not a point of view with which O&#8217;Dwyer has much sympathy. &#8220;It&#8217;s never occurred to me not to vote,&#8221; said O&#8217;Dwyer. &#8220;The whole <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/russell-brand\" class=\" u-underline\">Russell Brand</a>, non-voting thing is ridiculous: if one group of people don&#8217;t vote, all it means is that their voices won&#8217;t be heard. How can that be empowering? It&#8217;s exactly the opposite.&#8221;</p>\n<p>O&#8217;Dwyer, who is studying economics, music and photography A-levels at La Swap sixth form consortium in north London, is pro-European and socially liberal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we need to stay in the EU because there&#8217;s free movement in Europe and trade agreements which benefit us,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any issues with immigration because I love living in a multicultural society and there are many benefits of immigration. I support Labour on limiting zero-hour contracts because it&#8217;s important to be earning a steady wage and know how much you&#8217;re getting paid each week.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bigg, who is studying English, maths and biology at the co-ed sixth-form of Camden School for Girls, also believes that staying in the EU is important. &#8220;I side with Miliband on this one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I also think that immigration is good for the country and Farage&#8217;s spiel about the immigrants ruining the country is totally wrong. At my secondary school, there were a lot of kids whose parents were immigrants and they were extremely nice and hard-working guys who would definitely benefit the country, and so I don&#8217;t think that immigration should be cut.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also think that zero-hour contracts are bad because they offer little job security. I think these issues are important, especially immigration, which I would say is equally as important as the environment and tuition fees.&#8221;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s never occurred to me not to vote. The whole Russell Brand, non-voting thing is ridiculous</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So how will they vote? Both teenagers say they &#8220;don&#8217;t see what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\" class=\" u-underline\">Nigel Farage</a> and Ukip&#8217;s problem is&#8221; over immigration and heartily disagree with him on both Europe and the environment. &#8220;Someone from Ukip came to our school to talk to us and said that it hadn&#8217;t been proven whether man-made climate change is happening or not,&#8221; said Bigg. &#8220;That sort of talk is incredibly dangerous. But none of the parties, apart from the Greens, are taking it seriously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Green party leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/natalie-bennett\" class=\" u-underline\">Natalie Bennett</a>, also came to speak at Bigg&#8217;s school. &#8220;Although I like her policies, they would be vastly expensive and the only way she could justify them to us was to say they&#8217;d raise taxes for the wealthy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s realistic: all the other parties are talking about reducing the deficit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bigg said he could not forgive Clegg for his volte-face over tuition fees. &#8220;I understand that you have to make compromises in government but promising to scrap tuition fees then raising them is not OK. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the sign of a good leader.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Only vaguely aware of Thatcher&#8217;s legacy, Bigg added that he would find it impossible to vote for the Conservatives. &#8220;Calling the Conservatives the party of the working person is ridiculous when all their policies benefit the rich at the expense of the less well-off,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n<p>But despite where he lives and his parents&#8217; voting intentions &#8211; both are staunch Labour supporters &#8211; Miliband isn&#8217;t the perfect fit for Bigg either. &#8220;I like Miliband and would trust him with the economy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The fact that he went to a local comprehensive means he&#8217;s more down to earth than the others. I also like how he isn&#8217;t as well drilled as Cameron and is, to be honest, a bit weird.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But by trying to get votes from the middle ground, Labour has swung too much to the centre, Bigg believes &#8220;The truth is, there&#8217;s not really that good a leftwing party in England,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m still not sure how I&#8217;ll vote: Labour or Green. It would be good for the Greens to have more seats, so their voice can be heard, but I definitely don&#8217;t think they should be running the country.&#8221;</p>\n<p>O&#8217;Dwyer also comes from a strong Labour background. She was deeply affected by the leaders&#8217; debates on the television. &#8220;I thought that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\" class=\" u-underline\">Ed Miliband</a> did well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The fact that Cameron didn&#8217;t speak much and refused to do a head-to-head with him implies he&#8217;s nervous. I quite like the Green party but Natalie Bennett didn&#8217;t answer the questions very well, and in that radio interview she didn&#8217;t seem to know what her policies even were.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll be voting Labour because I like their position on cutting tuition fees and the mansion tax,&#8221; she added. &#8220;But if there was another option that was better for the common people, I&#8217;d choose that. There&#8217;s no really fully leftwing party. If there was something like that socialist party in Greece here, I&#8217;d vote for them. My perfect party would be a combination of Labour, Greens and Communists.&#8221;</p>\n</div>",
