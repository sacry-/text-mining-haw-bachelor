With the DUP very likely to take eight or nine seats, the key number for the Tories is again a sum: the total seats held by the two current coalition parties needs to be above 315, which would deliver a majority for &#8220;Coalition 2&#8221; with support from the Northern Irish DUP.

Carswell looks safe, but Reckless is struggling. By far the most important result of the night for the party comes at 6am, when the verdict of South Thanet voters on Nigel Farage will be known. Defeat for the Ukip leader, who trails in the most recent polling, will trigger his resignation and a potentially bloody leadership battle, so the stakes could not be higher.\n\nKey numbers\n\nGood (>3) Gains would be a boost, notably if Nigel Farage wins South Thanet.\n\nBad (1-2) Party\u2019s bubble bursts unless it scores dozens of second places.\n\nAwful (<1) If it loses one MP and Farage doesn\u2019t win, Ukip will have flopped.\n\nTHE FIELD\n\nThe Greens look set to increase their vote share but have very few chances to win seats \u2013 Bristol West and Norwich South (4.30am) are probably their best hopes.\n\nPlaid Cymru has had a good campaign, with the TV leaders\u2019 events giving its leader, Leanne Wood, unusual exposure on the national stage. Its top targets are Lib Dem-held Ceredigion (4am) and Labour-held Ynys M\u00f4n (2am) and Llanelli (2am).\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party will look to regain Belfast East, where party leader Peter Robinson suffered a shock defeat in 2010.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in will hope to defend Fermanagh & South Tyrone, the most marginal seat in the UK, which it won by only four votes in 2010.\n\nPossibly the most polarising local campaign in England is taking place in Bradford West, where Respect\u2019s George Galloway is in a tight race to defend a seat taken in a shock 2012 byelection win.\n\nThe return of the NHS to the top of the issue agenda may help one of Britain\u2019s more unusual politicians, Dr Richard Taylor of Health Concern, return for a third stint as MP for Wyre Forest at the age of 80.",
