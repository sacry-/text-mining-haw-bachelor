A part of me thought if he&#8217;s going for it he&#8217;d break it because he&#8217;s quite calculating like that. He wouldn&#8217;t have gone for it if he wasn&#8217;t sure. He&#8217;d have done his homework. Everyone says how horrific it is &#8211; even Rohan Dennis said it was one of the worst things he&#8217;s ever done &#8211; but Alex proved that with his pedigree in time-trialling.

It was frustrating to be so close to the 53km mark. It was always the plan to just break the record not blow it out of the ballpark. I have experience of the record now, I know what the last 10, 15, 20 minutes are like, I know how to handle the heat. I think I can certainly improve and as things stand, it&#8217;s no secret Brad&#8217;s going well.
