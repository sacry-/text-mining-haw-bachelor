  "article_html": "<div><p>In October 2013, when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" class=\" u-underline\">Russell Brand declared on Newsnight</a> that he had never voted, not out of apathy but &#8220;out of absolute indifference and weariness&#8221;, Denise Felkin noticed a ripple of agreement among her friends on social media. Doing an MA in photojournalism at the time, she was looking for a politically relevant idea for her final major project and <a href=\"http://www.denisefelkin.com/voting.htm\" class=\" u-underline\">I&#8217;m not voting because&#8230;</a> is the result: portraits of people aged 17 to 71 who, for varying reasons, don&#8217;t &#8211; or won&#8217;t &#8211; vote.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[I wanted] to create a photographic historic record of a political movement that hasn&#8217;t been widely publicised and to give a human face to the nonconformists,&#8221; Felkin explains. She discovered it was easy to find non-voters for the project: &#8220;I&#8217;d turn up to someone&#8217;s house to take a photo of them and other people there would say, &#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s me as well.&#8217;&#8221; After photographing around 20 people, she chose just nine for the series; a hat-tip to the German nein, &#8220;to represent a &#8216;no&#8217;&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Felkin, 47, voted aged 18 and again in 2010, but admits there were many elections in between when she didn&#8217;t. For her, and some of her subjects, not voting is a political stance in itself. &#8220;Roger feels about it really strongly, so much so that he would go to the polling station and spoil his paper,&#8221; she tells me. I ask Roger about this, and he says: &#8220;I am going to vote, but I&#8217;m just going to put &#8216;none of the above&#8217;.&#8221; Laura feels similarly. &#8220;I think striking them all is a brilliant idea. It&#8217;s a start to breaking up the system &#8211; it might be something for people to think about next time. A lot of people this time are doing strategic voting just to get the Tories out, but I went out with an Etonian when I was a teenager who had two uncles who were politicians, and I&#8217;ve come to realise that Lib Dem, Labour, they&#8217;re all from the same old boys&#8217; club, and we have to trust them but we can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This complete lack of trust in politicians is the main thing the people I speak to from Felkin&#8217;s project have in common. They uniformly feel let down, whether that&#8217;s due to benefit cuts, the housing crisis, or cuts to the NHS. &#8220;Politicians go on TV and say, &#8216;We can give you this, we can give you that&#8217; and make false promises they can&#8217;t keep,&#8221; says Sam, who can&#8217;t work due to mental health problems and who had her benefits cut.</p>\n<p>Not one of them doesn&#8217;t get passionate talking about politics &#8211; this isn&#8217;t apathy; it&#8217;s frustration. They feel that not voting is their last resort. &#8220;If more people spoil their paper when they vote, eventually, an MP&#8217;s got to have the common sense to address that and think: why?&#8221; says Roger. Laura suggests an alternative to what she sees as the outdated way government works. &#8220;It would be really good if we could vote on aspects of politics that interested us on our smartphones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just those who can vote who Felkin photographed. She feels under-18s are too often left out of politics, and wanted to redress that by including them in her project. &#8220;When you talk to younger people, for example Amos, or Rhiannon and Pariss, they just don&#8217;t care about voting and they haven&#8217;t been taught about it at school.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She points out that Junior, who is unable to speak, bought his &#8220;WTF&#8221; T-shirt especially for the shoot to symbolise his stance: even though he is too young to vote, he says he wouldn&#8217;t anyway.</p>\n<p>Now based between Brighton and Colchester, Felkin spent her coming-of-age years in Tamworth in the 80s, pogoing to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sexpistols\" class=\" u-underline\">the Sex Pistols</a> and learning about Thatcher&#8217;s government through The Young Ones, Spitting Image and Not the Nine O&#8217;Clock News. It&#8217;s an era that has inadvertently informed her work ever since. When, in the mid&#8209;90s, she was studying for her fine art degree in Sunderland, &#8220;my tutor said that my work always had this real 80s feel about it&#8230; I felt that was a bit of a criticism back then, but when I came to my project this time, I thought, &#8216;Actually, it&#8217;s not such a bad thing &#8211; that makes it personal.&#8217;&#8221; Inspired by artists such as Manet, Felkin likes her photos to have painterly qualities, and admires the work of London-based photographer <a href=\"http://www.tomhunter.org/\" class=\" u-underline\">Tom Hunter</a>.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, Felkin was uncertain if she was going to vote this year, but the project has made up her mind: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to not vote, and then the Conservatives get back in again,&#8221; she says, although she still empathises with people who have no interest in voting. &#8220;In a way, politics is a bit like religion, isn&#8217;t it? You either believe or don&#8217;t believe.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>&#8216;I never have. I&#8217;ve always realised that it&#8217;s pointless&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n<a href=\"/artanddesign/2015/may/03/i-wont-be-voting-because#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430325420744/6267bfcd-f3fa-4732-aef7-90a93c7d3200-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"David, 48, Brighton\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48xf2%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I+won%E2%80%99t+be+voting+because%E2%80%A6&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48xf2%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=I+won%E2%80%99t+be+voting+because%E2%80%A6&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fartanddesign%2F2015%2Fmay%2F03%2Fi-wont-be-voting-because&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F29%2F1430325422317%2F6267bfcd-f3fa-4732-aef7-90a93c7d3200-2060x2060.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nDavid, 48, Brighton.

  "text": "In October 2013, when Russell Brand declared on Newsnight that he had never voted, not out of apathy but \u201cout of absolute indifference and weariness\u201d, Denise Felkin noticed a ripple of agreement among her friends on social media. Doing an MA in photojournalism at the time, she was looking for a politically relevant idea for her final major project and I\u2019m not voting because\u2026 is the result: portraits of people aged 17 to 71 who, for varying reasons, don\u2019t \u2013 or won\u2019t \u2013 vote.\n\n\u201c[I wanted] to create a photographic historic record of a political movement that hasn\u2019t been widely publicised and to give a human face to the nonconformists,\u201d Felkin explains. She discovered it was easy to find non-voters for the project: \u201cI\u2019d turn up to someone\u2019s house to take a photo of them and other people there would say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s me as well.\u2019\u201d After photographing around 20 people, she chose just nine for the series; a hat-tip to the German nein, \u201cto represent a \u2018no\u2019\u201d.\n\nFelkin, 47, voted aged 18 and again in 2010, but admits there were many elections in between when she didn\u2019t. For her, and some of her subjects, not voting is a political stance in itself. \u201cRoger feels about it really strongly, so much so that he would go to the polling station and spoil his paper,\u201d she tells me. I ask Roger about this, and he says: \u201cI am going to vote, but I\u2019m just going to put \u2018none of the above\u2019.\u201d Laura feels similarly. \u201cI think striking them all is a brilliant idea. It\u2019s a start to breaking up the system \u2013 it might be something for people to think about next time. A lot of people this time are doing strategic voting just to get the Tories out, but I went out with an Etonian when I was a teenager who had two uncles who were politicians, and I\u2019ve come to realise that Lib Dem, Labour, they\u2019re all from the same old boys\u2019 club, and we have to trust them but we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis complete lack of trust in politicians is the main thing the people I speak to from Felkin\u2019s project have in common. They uniformly feel let down, whether that\u2019s due to benefit cuts, the housing crisis, or cuts to the NHS. \u201cPoliticians go on TV and say, \u2018We can give you this, we can give you that\u2019 and make false promises they can\u2019t keep,\u201d says Sam, who can\u2019t work due to mental health problems and who had her benefits cut.\n\nNot one of them doesn\u2019t get passionate talking about politics \u2013 this isn\u2019t apathy; it\u2019s frustration. They feel that not voting is their last resort. \u201cIf more people spoil their paper when they vote, eventually, an MP\u2019s got to have the common sense to address that and think: why?\u201d says Roger. Laura suggests an alternative to what she sees as the outdated way government works. \u201cIt would be really good if we could vote on aspects of politics that interested us on our smartphones.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just those who can vote who Felkin photographed. She feels under-18s are too often left out of politics, and wanted to redress that by including them in her project. \u201cWhen you talk to younger people, for example Amos, or Rhiannon and Pariss, they just don\u2019t care about voting and they haven\u2019t been taught about it at school.\u201d\n\nShe points out that Junior, who is unable to speak, bought his \u201cWTF\u201d T-shirt especially for the shoot to symbolise his stance: even though he is too young to vote, he says he wouldn\u2019t anyway.\n\nNow based between Brighton and Colchester, Felkin spent her coming-of-age years in Tamworth in the 80s, pogoing to the Sex Pistols and learning about Thatcher\u2019s government through The Young Ones, Spitting Image and Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News. It\u2019s an era that has inadvertently informed her work ever since. When, in the mid\u201190s, she was studying for her fine art degree in Sunderland, \u201cmy tutor said that my work always had this real 80s feel about it\u2026 I felt that was a bit of a criticism back then, but when I came to my project this time, I thought, \u2018Actually, it\u2019s not such a bad thing \u2013 that makes it personal.\u2019\u201d Inspired by artists such as Manet, Felkin likes her photos to have painterly qualities, and admires the work of London-based photographer Tom Hunter.\n\nA few months ago, Felkin was uncertain if she was going to vote this year, but the project has made up her mind: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to not vote, and then the Conservatives get back in again,\u201d she says, although she still empathises with people who have no interest in voting. \u201cIn a way, politics is a bit like religion, isn\u2019t it? You either believe or don\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\n\u2018I never have. I\u2019ve always realised that it\u2019s pointless\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David, 48, Brighton.

I have no idea what is going on with the government\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amos, 17, Devon.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not old enough\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Junior, 17, Sussex.\n\n\u2018It does not matter how hard you scream or protest, they won\u2019t listen to us\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sammy, 30, Brighton.\n\n\u2018I do not trust any of them\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roger, 71, Worthing.
