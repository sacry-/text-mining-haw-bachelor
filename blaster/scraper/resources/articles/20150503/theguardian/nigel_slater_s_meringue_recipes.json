First, use egg whites cold from the fridge, not at room temperature. They seem to whip to a stiffer texture (the proteins in the egg white are more stable when cold). Second is the trick of warming the sugar in the oven before adding it, gradually, to the fluffed-up whites. You will get a glossier, stiffer result.</p>\n<h2>Meringues with lime curd and pistachios</h2>\n<p>Makes 8<br>for the meringues:<br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 250g<br><strong>egg whites</strong> 6<br><strong>cornflour</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>white-wine vinegar</strong> 2 tsp</p>\n<p>for the filling:<br><strong>limes</strong> 2<br><strong>lemons</strong> 2<br><strong>butter</strong> 100g<br><strong>egg yolks</strong> 4<br><strong>pistachios</strong> 100g (50g shelled), salted <br></p>\n<p>Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Scatter the sugar in a fine layer over a baking sheet and place in the oven for 5 minutes or so to warm.</p>\n<p>Put the egg whites into a deep mixing bowl, then beat fairly slowly, until white and fluffy. This works best with a food mixer and a whisk attachment, but a hand whisk will do the trick, too.</p>\n<p>Tip the warm sugar, a few tablespoons at a time, into the egg whites, beating all the time at a moderate to high speed. Continue for a good 5 minutes until the mixture is stiff and glossy. They should be able to stand in stiff, shiny peaks. Mix in the cornflour and the vinegar.</p>\n<p>Line a baking sheet with nonstick baking parchment, or use a very lightly oiled baking sheet dusted with a very fine layer of flour. Using a large serving spoon, place eight generous piles of the mixture, each about the size of a goose egg, on to the baking sheet. Place in the preheated oven and immediately lower the heat, door closed, to 140C/gas mark 1. Bake the meringues for 35-40 minutes until crisp on the outside. They should be soft and marshmallow-like within. Allow the meringues to cool on the tray before moving, with the help of a palette knife, to a cooling rack.</p>\n<p>To make the filling, finely grate the zest of the limes and lemons into a heatproof bowl that will sit comfortably in the top of a small saucepan. Squeeze thelime and lemon juice into the bowl then place the bowl over a pan of simmering water. Cut the butter into small pieces, then drop them into the juice and zest and leave to melt, stirring occasionally. Beat the yolks lightly to mix, then pour into the juice and zest, a little at a time, stirring regularly. Warm the butter, egg and juice mixture and leave to thicken, for roughly 20 minutes, beating regularly with a wooden spoon. You are after a consistency that feels heavy on the spoon, with the thickness of a light mayonnaise. The curd won&#8217;t actually set until it has cooled. Remove the curd from the heat and let it cool, then refrigerate. The rest will keep for a few days in the fridge.</p>\n<p>To serve, place the meringues on individual plates or a serving dish, lightly crush the top of each with a spoon, then place a spoonful of curd in each hollow. Roughly chop the pistachios and scatter over the tops.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/lifeandstyle/2015/may/03/nigel-slater-meringue-recipes#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430228914235/ab7d2b2e-7794-4348-9c91-1641a7e44f0e-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Rectangular walnut meringue with apples, custard and almond slivers\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48v2b%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Nigel+Slater%E2%80%99s+meringue+recipes&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48v2b%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Nigel+Slater%E2%80%99s+meringue+recipes&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Flifeandstyle%2F2015%2Fmay%2F03%2Fnigel-slater-meringue-recipes&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F28%2F1430228914829%2Fab7d2b2e-7794-4348-9c91-1641a7e44f0e-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nCrunch time: Nigel Slater&#8217;s walnut meringue with apples and custard recipe.
