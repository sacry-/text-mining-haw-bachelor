Irrelevant neuroscience information \u2013 or \u201cneurobabble\u201d \u2013 makes for the most convincing scientific explanations, according to researchers at Villanova University and the University of Oregon.\n\nScientists gave a group of 385 students brief descriptions of psychological phenomena, including face recognition, spatial memory, and emotional states, each accompanied by superfluous explanations for them, derived from neuroscience, social sciences, or \u201chard\u201d sciences such as physics. Neuroscientific explanations \u2013 involving phrases such as \u201cprefrontal cortex\u201d and \u201cneural circuitry\u201d \u2013 were consistently rated the most convincing, even when the information was pointless and offered no further insight.
