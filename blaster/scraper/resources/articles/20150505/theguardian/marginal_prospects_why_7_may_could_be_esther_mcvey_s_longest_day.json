Labour bristles at the accusation.\n\n\n\nIn truth, her Labour rival for the seat, former English teacher Margaret Greenwood, does a poor impression of a misogynist. She is calm and mild-mannered, but when asked if the campaign had become nasty, fires back: \u201cNot from us, we are working hard on our campaign \u2013 we don\u2019t do nasty.\u201d It was a Labour activist who reported the anti-McVey graffito, she adds, saying: \u201cWe would never condone such an act, and to suggest we would is appalling.\u201d\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret Greenwood, the Labour candidate for Wirral West, pictured in Woodchurch. Photograph: Jon Super\n\nGreenwood, unsurprisingly, wants to focus on confidence in the Labour Wirral troops, who have been visited by Ed Miliband and John Prescott in recent weeks. \u201cWe are feeling really good about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have a fantastic campaign team, and on the doorstep people are saying \u2018you know we are going to vote for you\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe former community campaigner, who unsuccessfully urged McVey to not to vote for the health and social care bill, is focusing on the NHS (\u201cI really believe we will lose it if the Tories get back in\u201d) and cuts to public services that she says have left vulnerable people on the brink.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor me a key part of being an MP is listening to the people who are the least able to articulate themselves,\u201d she says. While McVey is a \u201cstrong candidate\u201d with a \u201chigh profile\u201d there is \u201ca real contrast between her and me\u201d, she says. \u201cShe is clearly a media person and I come from a community activist background. Going to grassroots meetings, finding out people\u2019s concerns \u2013 I enjoy that. I do care about people.\u201d\n\n\n\nRelated: Senior Tory Esther McVey says she would like to be prime minister\n\nThe fate of McVey \u2013 who admitted to wanting to be prime minister on the ITV show Loose Women \u2013 hangs in the balance. But Tory activists believe she can hang on to Wirral West. Tony Caldeira, former Conservative mayoral candidate in Liverpool, is effusive in his praise for the \u201cLiverpool girl who has risen through the ranks\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think Esther will hang on, she is popular in the constituency, people respect what she has achieved and I hope that will be more than enough to get her over the line,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose Esther, she has done us all proud.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a constituency as split down tribal lines as this one, who will be MP for Wirral West on 8 May will come down to which tribe is the most successful at energising its base, he admits.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hand-to-hand combat with Labour activists in the streets of Wirral West,\u201d says Caldeira. \u201cIt will go down to hundreds, maybe even tens of votes \u2013 it\u2019s that close. Everything will come down to who gets their vote out. May 7 is going to be a very long day.\u201d",
