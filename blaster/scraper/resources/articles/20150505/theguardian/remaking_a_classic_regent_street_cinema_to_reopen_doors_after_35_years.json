There was little to suggest to this audience, many of whom had wandered in from the street, that for the price of a shilling they would be about to witness cinematic history. For this series of silent, grainy, 40-second scenes of ordinary life, hand-cranked through a projector, were the first pieces of moving footage to be shown in the UK. It would go on to form the foundations of the multimillion-pound global film industry we know today.<br></p>\n<p>The Lumi&#232;re Brothers, who shot the footage, may have later declared that there was &#8220;no future in cinema&#8221; but this screening was the first of thousands hosted in this grand central London picture house.

All the art deco features from the cinema&#8217;s first renovation in the 1920s have been restored, as has the building&#8217;s domed ceiling and even the original 1936 John Compton organ, used to soundtrack silent films. </p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/film/2015/may/05/regent-street-cinema-reopen-35-years#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430847333988/acdb5a9c-8297-49d1-b586-d6019fe9737a-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 05:  General view of the interior of the Regent Cinema on May 5, 2015 in London, England.
