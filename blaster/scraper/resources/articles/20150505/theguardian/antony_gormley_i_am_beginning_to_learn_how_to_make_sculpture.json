But Gormley is already off, bounding with admirable agility down the treacherous path to get a better view of the nesting birds below us.</p>\n<p>We have only been together on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/18/country-diary-lundy-1964\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">Lundy</a>, the tiny former Norse settlement 12 miles off the coast of Devon, for less than an hour but one thing has become apparent. While Gormley&#8217;s sculptures have, for almost four decades, been firmly rooted in the physicality of the human body, he finds the natural world in its raw, untameable form just as intoxicating. He grabs armfuls of the white granite pebbles at our feet, marvelling at their milky colour; runs his hands over the rough lichen coating the rocks; and delightedly walks me over to a drystone wall where ancient ivy had grown into strange pointed shapes &#8220;like penises blowing in the wind&#8221;. Later, in the evening, he insists we collect wood to build a fire, and takes to breaking fallen branches with the enthusiasm of a huntsman.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t just come to this stark granite outpost to admire the view, though. The three-mile-long island recently became home to a work from the sculptor&#8217;s latest series, Land. A modernist figure, of human height and made from stacked cubes of weathered iron, the piece was installed right on the edge of the island, peering westwards over Lundy&#8217;s dramatic natural landmark, <a href=\"http://www.lundy.org.uk/tour/location.php?loc=3\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">Devil&#8217;s Limekiln</a>. The sculpture is one of five body forms that Gormley has erected across the UK to mark the 50th anniversary of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/06/antony-gormley-sculptures-landmark-trust\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">Landmark Trust</a>, which rescues buildings of historical merit and repurposes them by renting them out. As well as the west-facing figure on Lundy, Gormley has crafted a bodily sculpture to stand on three other isolated coastal spots: <a href=\"http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/saddell-castle-11597/\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">Saddell Beach</a> on the Mull of Kintyre (facing east), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/29/architecture.heritage\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">Clavell Tower</a> on Dorset&#8217;s Jurassic Coast (facing south) and the <a href=\"http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/martello-tower-9317\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">Martello Tower</a> in Aldeburgh (facing north).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want these sculptures to be markers, 21st-century standing stones</p>\n\nAntony Gormley\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They are, he says, places &#8220;potent&#8221; for contemplation, where the sculptures and any visitors stand fully exposed to the natural elements and the expansive horizon. One final sculpture will be placed inland, looking down into the canal lock at <a href=\"http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/our-landmarks/properties/lengthsmans-cottage-3703/\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">Lengthsman&#8217;s cottage in Warwickshire</a>, a nod to the exploitation of nature for industrial means. &#8220;In many senses, I want these sculptures to be markers, 21st-century standing stones,&#8221; says Gormley. &#8220;Rather than being representative or narrative, I just want them to be catalysts for retrospection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Indeed, as we first reach the figure on Lundy, Gormley insists we just sit on the clifftop in contemplative silence. With the distractions of phone and 3G signal a resolute 12 miles away, I oblige and together we perch at the feet of the sculpture, following its gaze westwards. For 10 minutes, neither of us exchanges a word.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/artanddesign/2015/may/05/antony-gormley-sculpture-lundy-landmark-trust#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430841445761/6f716544-06cc-4418-ac71-7a795bffe202-313x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Antony Gormley.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485yn%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Antony+Gormley%3A+%27I+am+beginning+to+learn+how+to+make+sculpture%27&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485yn%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Antony+Gormley%3A+%27I+am+beginning+to+learn+how+to+make+sculpture%27&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fartanddesign%2F2015%2Fmay%2F05%2Fantony-gormley-sculpture-lundy-landmark-trust&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F5%2F1430841444413%2F6f716544-06cc-4418-ac71-7a795bffe202-1330x2040.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nAntony Gormley.
