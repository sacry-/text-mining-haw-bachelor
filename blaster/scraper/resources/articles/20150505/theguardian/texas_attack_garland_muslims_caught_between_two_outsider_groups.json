We have the right to practice the religion in this country as long as it doesn\u2019t do harm to yourself or others \u2013 and Islam does.\u201d\n\nJohn, who had a \u201cSharia-free zone\u201d bumper sticker on his pickup truck, described the attendees as a \u201cvery constitutionalist, very Christian crowd\u201d. His attendance was meant to be read as a defense of constitutional rights, he said.\n\nJim Harman, a 46-year-old Dallas resident and business owner, said he had attended the event the previous night to support Geller, the Dutch far-right populist politician Geert Wilders and \u201cthose who are on the frontlines giving clarity to the situation\u201d \u2013 that is, those who are declaring that Islam and civil society are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jim Harman: \u2018This isn\u2019t about some cartoons. This is about showing the contrast between good and evil.\u2019 Photograph: Raya Jalabi\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about some cartoons,\u201d Harman said. \u201cThis is about showing the contrast between good and evil\u201d and to counter the \u201cslow bleed of encouragement\u201d that the government gives to \u201cradical\u201d groups like CAIR.\n\nWhatever their feelings, local Muslims had but one reaction to the event itself: ignore it. Not one of the 100,000 local Muslims had come out to protest against Geller\u2019s event, in accordance with guidance given by Muslim leaders.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t want to give her the time of day,\u201d Hamideh said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t worth our breath.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Lauren Gambino",
