Parvez, who is gay and Muslim, has had death threats for making the film, leading to increased security at the festival screenings. </p>\n<p>The film explores Sharma&#8217;s complicated relationship with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/islam\" class=\" u-underline\">Islam</a> as he embarks on the hajj, the devotional pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, which all Muslims are required to make at least once in their lifetime. Sharma, who was born in India but is based in New York, sets out to answer the question: is it possible for someone like him to be a good Muslim? &#8220;I need evidence that my faith is strong enough to survive this journey,&#8221; he explains early in the film, which was recorded on a cameraphone and two smuggled-in cameras.
