Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not often I write this, but <strong>Nick Clegg</strong> might well be starting the day with a smile on his face. First, there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/04/breathtaking-surge-of-tory-tactical-votes-to-save-nick-clegg-in-hallam-poll\" class=\" u-underline\">the Guardian/ICM poll</a> that found him on course &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/01/nick-clegg-on-course-to-lose-seat-at-election-according-lord-ashcroft-poll\" class=\" u-underline\">despite earlier polling predictions</a> &#8211; to save his own seat.</p>\n<p>OK, it&#8217;s no Cleggmania Part Two: his seven-point lead in Sheffield Hallam is because almost half the people (48%) who say their nationwide preference is for the Conservatives are planning to support the Lib Dem leader (leaving the Tories&#8217; own candidate in the constituency on a measly 12%). And a party leader retaining his own seat is hardly the stuff of electoral dreams.</p>\n<p>(Those with long memories might also recall that a last-minute <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Rally\" class=\" u-underline\">Sheffield rally</a> doesn&#8217;t always bode well.)<br></p>\n<p>But the Lib Dem leader has had a further boost from <strong>the Independent</strong>, which has backed him in an editorial that called for the continuation of the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition. You can read the story about that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/04/independent-conservative-liberal-democrat-coalition-cameron-clegg\" class=\" u-underline\">here</a> and the editorial itself is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/in-defence-of-liberal-democracy-10224221.html\" class=\" u-underline\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quoted\">\n<p>Nick Clegg may not personally recover from the tuition fees debacle, despite being right (eventually). But history will record him as the man who turned a party of protest into one of government. As a principled, effective politician who could hold another coalition together, we hope he keeps his seat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clegg should insist on being education secretary in the next government, the Independent says, before adding:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quoted\">\n<p>Any partnership between Labour and the SNP will harm Britain&#8217;s fragile democracy. For all its faults, another Lib-Con coalition would both prolong recovery and give our kingdom a better chance of continued existence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Times</strong>, too, has taken a sympathetic look at Clegg&#8217;s five years in government and <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article4430579.ece?CMP=Spklr-_-Editorial-_-TWITTER-_-thetimes-_-20150505-_-CommentandOpinion-_-176410148&amp;linkId=13953444\" class=\" u-underline\">decided he deserves another shot</a>:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quoted\">\n<p>The deputy prime minister has been more maligned than any politician in Britain these past five years.

An incumbent government is entitled to wait until the new parliament has met to see if it can command the confidence of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons\" class=\" u-underline\">House of Commons</a>, but is expected to resign if it becomes clear that it is unlikely to be able to command that confidence and there is a clear alternative.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The argument will then turn on whether convention expects the prime minister to resign as soon as it is clear that they no longer command a majority. Some argue precedent, with expert opinion saying the leader of the largest opposition party will be appointed prime minister.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Guardian&#8217;s data editor, <strong>Alberto Nardelli</strong>, says the permutations make tactical voting this Thursday &#8220;an even more important issue than in other elections&#8221;. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/04/how-to-vote-tactically-election\" class=\" u-underline\">Here&#8217;s his guide to how to do it.</a></p>\n<h2>Read these</h2>\n<p>The view from abroad today, as the world wonders who it&#8217;ll be dealing with come Friday:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-explains-ukips-success-in-clacton-but-nowhere-else/\" class=\" u-underline\">For US polling guru <strong>Nate Silver</strong>&#8217;s Five Thirty Eight</a>, <strong>Mona Chalabi</strong> takes a trip to Clacton to try to explain Ukip:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"quoted\">\n<p>Voters over the age of 40 are <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/evhbhxbwz2/YG-Archive-Pol-Sun-results-270415.pdf\" class=\" u-underline\">twice</a> as likely to vote Ukip as those under 40.

We\u2019ll have live coverage every day from 7am till late until polling day on Thursday.

Certainly the latter seemed rather won over by David Cameron in an interview he conducted himself \u2013 with lots of pictures of them together \u2013 for the Evening Standard (which the Lebedevs also own, and which is expected to unveil its own endorsement of the Conservatives).\n\nIn February, Lebedev Sr told the Guardian it would be up to his editors to decide which political parties to back. Certainly the Independent on Sunday took a different stance, insisting it would stay \u201ctrue to our name \u2026 while our rivals have reverted to their ideological bunkers\u201d and not advise its readers which way to vote.\n\n(Cross Independent readers \u2013 and the comments under the editorial suggest there are a few \u2013 might prefer Steve Richards\u2019 take, in the same organ.)\n\nYou should also know:\n\nEd Miliband has warned that the NHS faces a financial bombshell, with two-thirds of hospital trusts face having to make \u201cswingeing cuts\u201d, after a leaked internal document showed that the health service is projected to run a deficit of nearly \u00a32bn this year.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Guardian news (@guardiannews) Guardian front page, Tuesday 5 May 2015: Miliband\u2019s warning \u2013 NHS faces financial bombshell pic.twitter.com/WzCBjprPBg\n\nThere was no bollocking.

It would be accused by opponents of being a \u2018coalition of the losers\u2019. Many Lib Dems would be opposed to minority coalition: not only would the party have to compromise yet again on its policies in return for power, but it would also have even less chance of getting its own policies implemented.\n\nHe\u2019s behind you. But Ed Miliband might yet become PM. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images\n\nAlternatively, as my colleagues Patrick Wintour and Rowena Mason report, Cameron could try to \u201ccling on to power\u201d with the support of the Lib Dems and Democratic Unionists. They offer a helpful guide to the (albeit not very helpful) rules:\n\nIt is argued that the Cabinet Manual \u2013 the civil service book setting out the rules on the transfer of power \u2013 states a prime minister can stay only until the point at which it is clear they cannot command the confidence of the Commons; not when any other party demonstrates they can form a majority or requires a vote in the House. The relevant section of the manual states: \u201cWhere an election does not result in an overall majority for a single party, the incumbent government remains in office unless and until the prime minister tenders his or her resignation and the government\u2019s resignation to the sovereign. An incumbent government is entitled to wait until the new parliament has met to see if it can command the confidence of the House of Commons, but is expected to resign if it becomes clear that it is unlikely to be able to command that confidence and there is a clear alternative.\u201d The argument will then turn on whether convention expects the prime minister to resign as soon as it is clear that they no longer command a majority. Some argue precedent, with expert opinion saying the leader of the largest opposition party will be appointed prime minister.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s data editor, Alberto Nardelli, says the permutations make tactical voting this Thursday \u201can even more important issue than in other elections\u201d. Here\u2019s his guide to how to do it.\n\nRead these\n\nThe view from abroad today, as the world wonders who it\u2019ll be dealing with come Friday:\n\nFor US polling guru Nate Silver\u2019s Five Thirty Eight, Mona Chalabi takes a trip to Clacton to try to explain Ukip:\n\nVoters over the age of 40 are twice as likely to vote Ukip as those under 40. That may be because older voters have different priorities. While the economy, unemployment and education all rank high as concerns for the overall British electorate, they\u2019re lower on the list of worries among those who are going into, or are already in, retirement. That works to the disadvantage of other parties claiming that Britain\u2019s economic stability would be jeopardised by exiting the European Union. And that works to the advantage of Ukip, which is not well-versed in policy areas like the economy, having focused almost exclusively on the EU and immigration.\n\n\n\nSteven Erlanger, in the New York Times, profiles the two contenders for PM:\n\nDavid Cameron, 48, the red-cheeked toff who went to Eton and belonged to snooty clubs; and Ed Miliband, 45, the gawky, adenoidal, agnostic son of a Marxist Jewish refugee and historian \u2026 Both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, though part of a younger generation of leaders, have pulled their parties back to the past, toward older ideologies.\n\nAnd the Guardian has rounded up writers from Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung for a European take on the UK result:\n\nFace it, my beloved Britons: you\u2019ve got a weird electoral system. You might think it\u2019s normal that the Greens could get 10% of the vote and just one seat, while the SNP might end up with 4% and 50 seats. But it\u2019s not. Even if it does stop Ukip.\n\nEven the name is funny: first past the post. It sounds like a board game in which a team of journalists and a team of politicians jump from one marginal seat to another, with a rich lord called Ashcroft tossing the dice.\n\nCloser to home, do check out John Harris and John Domokos\u2019 diary of 11 weeks on the campaign trail up and down Britain; here they\u2019re in Bristol:\n\nIf the Greens are going to increase their support further, they\u2019re going to have to appeal to parts of the city where politics \u2013 of whatever hue \u2013 cuts very little ice. A good example is Redcliffe, where we spend two hours following a Green team around some threadbare low-rise flats. One twentysomething mother-to-be doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s an election on; neither do a group of young men crowded around a stairwell, though their spirits are lifted by news that the Greens support the decriminalisation of weed.\n\n\n\nThe day in a tweet\n\nChalking up half a point for the Lib Dems for their \u201cwomen are just like regular human beings\u201d video.
