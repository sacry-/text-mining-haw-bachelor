Busy tables are littered with discarded yellow raffle tickets and half-empty pints. On the small stage, a heavily pregnant woman belts out Purple Rain.</p>\n<p>Bob Gillespie stands by the entrance, shoulders filling out a tweed jacket, silently mouthing Prince&#8217;s words. The 77-year-old passed his love of a singalong on to his son, the raucous Primal Scream frontman who bears his name. In a gap between numbers, a middle-aged woman with tightly pursed lips stops for a chat. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I can help,&#8221; Gillespie says in a low, gravelly voice, flicking a hand through his white hair. She smiles, reassured.</p>\n<p>In his native city, Bob Gillespie&#8217;s reputation goes before him. He is the union firebrand who took on Robert Maxwell. He is also probably the most famous Labour MP that Glasgow never had, the man whose defeat in a supposedly unlosable 1988 byelection in Govan was a watershed moment for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland\" class=\" u-underline\">Scotland</a>, and Scottish nationalism.</p>\n<p>Outside the bar, the street is bathed in sunshine, illuminating a series of bright blue posters tacked up in the windows of a council flat. All say just one word: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Glasgow voted for independence last year. Now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\" class=\" u-underline\">Labour</a> seems set to lose dozens of Westminster seats in its onetime heartlands to the Scottish National party. If anyone knows what that feels like, it&#8217;s Bob Gillespie.</p>\n<p>In 1988 it was no summer of love in the shadows of the shipyards on the southern lip of Glasgow&#8217;s Clyde. Rangers had finished a lowly third in the league, behind bitter rivals Celtic. Margaret Thatcher was in the process of denationalising British Shipbuilders. Govan&#8217;s Fairfield yard would soon be sold off. That July, Labour leader Neil Kinnock nominated Govan MP Bruce Millan as a European Commissioner. The ensuing byelection would be a formality. In the previous year&#8217;s general election, Labour won a record victory in Scotland, returning 50 MPs. Millan took more than five times the vote of his nearest challenger in Govan. Scottish nationalists finished a distant fourth.</p>\n<p>Labour chose Gillespie as its candidate. Gillespie, a vivacious product of Glasgow&#8217;s docks, seemed a neat fit with working-class Govan. After returning from the navy with &#8220;Hong Kong&#8221; tattooed on his knuckles &#8211; a memento of a drunken escapade in the entrepot &#8211; Gillespie had built a formidable union career. By 1988, he was negotiating with print bosses across the UK.</p>\n<p>But it soon became apparent that Govan would not be as straightforward as the Labour hierarchy assumed. Labour was slumping in the polls. The self-styled &#8220;fighting fifty&#8221; Scottish Labour MPs elected in 1987 were powerless in Tory-controlled Westminster. Split on the issue of a devolved Scottish parliament, the party was equally divided about how to respond to the poll tax. The newly minted levy was to be implemented in Scotland first before being rolled out across the UK. Labour rejected proposals for mass non-payment. The Scottish National party saw its chance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our strategy in Govan was absolutely clear, to pin the Labour party on two points: they didn&#8217;t know what to do about the poll tax and they weren&#8217;t the party they were,&#8221; recalls Jim Sillars, the SNP&#8217;s candidate and himself a former Labour MP.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/politics/2015/may/05/bob-gillespie-labour-primal-scream-bobbie-scottish-politics#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430834145056/48aa0901-7feb-48c7-947d-8b2e297101c7-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Jim Sillars\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485hy%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bob+Gillespie%2C+the+SNP+and+Labour%27s+primal+scream&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485hy%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Bob+Gillespie%2C+the+SNP+and+Labour%27s+primal+scream&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2015%2Fmay%2F05%2Fbob-gillespie-labour-primal-scream-bobbie-scottish-politics&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F5%2F1430834144840%2F48aa0901-7feb-48c7-947d-8b2e297101c7-1020x612.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nJim Sillars, SNP candidate in the 1988 Glasgow Govan byelection. Photograph: Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>The SNP had form in Govan. In 1973, a glamorous 30-year-old publican named Margo MacDonald &#8211; nicknamed &#8220;the blonde bombshell&#8221; by an enraptured press corps &#8211; overturned a massive Labour majority to win a historic nationalist victory. By 1988, Sillars and MacDonald were husband and wife.</p>\n<p>But the political landscape in Govan had shifted in the decade and a half since MacDonald had shocked the Labour establishment. The defiant radicalism of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/11/jimmy-reid-obituary\" class=\" u-underline\">Jimmy Reid</a> and the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders was a fading memory. The SNP was openly loathed, blamed for ushering Thatcher into power after its support for a no-confidence motion precipitated the collapse of the James Callaghan administration in 1979.<br></p>\n<p>&#8220;We were despised,&#8221; says Sillars, leaning back on a tan easy chair in his ground-floor flat on Edinburgh&#8217;s southside. Near his slippered feet lie copies of Marx&#8217;s Capital, biographies of Hitler and Stalin, and Alex Salmond&#8217;s recent referendum campaign diary.</p>\n<p>Initially, the SNP&#8217;s aims in Govan were timorous. Reduce the Labour majority to a few thousand. Give the party a scare. But as the short byelection campaign began, the mood changed. Nationalists descended upon Govan. More than 500 turned out to canvass in one day alone. Sillars&#8217;s call to refuse to pay the poll tax chimed with an angry electorate. A Labour press officer drafted from London for the campaign later recalled the Proclaimers &#8220;driving round Govan on the back of a flatbed truck urging everyone to kick Labour where it hurt&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Bob Gillespie was struggling. Local Labour party membership numbered just 170. Many were of retirement age. Mirror Group owner Robert Maxwell used his titles &#8211; notably the influential and traditionally Labour-leaning Daily Record &#8211; to launch withering attacks on his union nemesis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maxwell always put gagging orders on people. He would never have been able to do that if you only spoke as an MP in the Palace of Westminster. So he went after me,&#8221; says Gillespie, with a rueful shake of his head. He offered to stand down. Kinnock would not hear of it: &#8220;He said: &#8216;You just have to do the best you can and I&#8217;ll have a go at Maxwell.&#8217;&#8221; The Labour leader would regret not heeding the warning.</p>\n<p>Days before the byelection, Gillespie floundered in a live debate on Scottish Television when asked a question about subsidiarity in the European Union. &#8220;Bob didn&#8217;t want to show his ignorance,&#8221; recalls Sillars. &#8220;He got so distracted trying to answer that he knocked over the microphone. That television debate was a disaster for Bob. So it was good for us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On 10 November 1988, two days after George HW Bush was elected US president, Govan went to the polls. Jim Sillars appeared on the ballot paper as &#8220;SNP Anti-Poll Tax Candidate&#8221;. He won a majority of 3,554 on a massive 33% swing.</p>\n<p>A BBC exit poll showed that 32% of Govan voters thought &#8220;representing Scotland&#8217;s interests&#8221; was the most important issue, followed by 21% citing the poll tax.

The Govan defeat, he wrote, was &#8220;a reflection of our failure to discuss constitutional questions, which are at the core of the devolution argument&#8221;.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I did more good for the children in Chernobyl.
