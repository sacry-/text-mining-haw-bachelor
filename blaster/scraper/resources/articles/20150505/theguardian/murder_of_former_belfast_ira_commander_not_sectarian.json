The murder was witnessed by children going to school about 9am. Davison, 47, was shot several times at point-blank range.</p>\n<p>The shooting took place at the corner of Welsh Street and Upper Stanfield Street, close to an office where Davison was employed as a local community worker.</p>\n<p>Local people reported children screaming, with one crying out: &#8220;Daddy, Daddy&#8221; when the gunman fired. Witnesses said the gunman was wearing a hooded jacket that concealed his face, and escaped by running into an alleyway.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the shooting a number of senior republicans from across Belfast descended on the inner-city area to support Davison&#8217;s family and friends.</p>\n<p>Davison is the most senior pro-peace process republican to have been killed since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ira\" class=\" u-underline\">IRA</a> ceasefire of 1997. Security sources said it was unlikely that any Ulster loyalist group was behind the murder, adding that the gunman may have come from within the nationalist community, possiblywith a longstanding grudge against the victim.</p>\n<p>Later on Tuesday, two senior PSNI detectives said they did not believe any of the hardline republican groups opposed to the peace process &#8211; the new IRA, the Continuity IRA or &#211;glaigh na h&#201;ireann &#8211; had been responsible for the killing.</p>\n<p>DCI Justyn Galloway and Ch Insp Robert Murdie also said there was no sectarian motive for the murder, thus excluding the possibility of an Ulster loyalist faction being involved. The two PSNI officers said cooperation from those in the Markets would be vital in their efforts to catch Davison&#8217;s killer. </p>\n<p>Several hours after the murder, the small working-class area close the city centre was still flooded with armed police officers manning checkpoints, while forensic officers combed the streets and alleyways near the murder scene for clues.</p>\n<p>The Sinn F&#233;in president, who has known the Davison family for several decades, condemned those behind the murder. Gerry Adams said: &#8220;This brutal act will be condemned by all sensible people &#8211; there can be no place today for such actions. I would urge anyone with any information to bring that forward to the PSNI.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The murdered man, who was in his late 40s, was a senior member of the Provisional IRA in the city and later a supporter of Sinn F&#233;in&#8217;s peace strategy.
