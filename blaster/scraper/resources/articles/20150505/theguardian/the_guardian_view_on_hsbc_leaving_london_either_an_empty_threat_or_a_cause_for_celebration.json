Last month, he warned that all this state-led beastliness could force Britain&#8217;s biggest bank to shift its headquarters overseas. This was greeted with a predictable hoo-hah &#8211; presumably just as Mr Flint wanted. As for HSBC&#8217;s chief executive, Mr Gulliver, he is an enthusiastic partner in this tag-team of whining.

These two claims are of course connected: if a corporation really thinks that paying taxes and following rules are too high a price to pay for staying in the UK, then the UK must not bend the rules or cut its taxes to get them to stay.
