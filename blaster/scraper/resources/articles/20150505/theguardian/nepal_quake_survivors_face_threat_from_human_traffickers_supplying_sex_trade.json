Girls and young women in these communities have long been targeted by traffickers, who abduct them and force them into sex work.</p>\n<p>The UN and local NGOs <a href=\"http://un.org.np/oneun/undaf/migrant_workers\" class=\" u-underline\">estimate 12,000 to 15,000 girls a year are trafficked from Nepal</a>. Some are taken overseas, to South Korea and as far as South Africa. But the majority end up in Indian brothels where tens of thousands are working in appalling conditions.</p>\n\n<p> Related: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/02/nepal-earthquake-swarathok-victims-help-themselves\" class=\" u-underline\">&#8216;No one has come&#8217;: one week on, Nepal quake victims help themselves</a> </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This is the time when the brokers go in the name of relief to kidnap or lure women.
