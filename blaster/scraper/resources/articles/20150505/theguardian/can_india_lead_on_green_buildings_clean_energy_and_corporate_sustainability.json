So while it nominally faces many of the same challenges as other BRIC nations &#8211; water scarcity, dirty energy supplies, human rights issues &#8211; India&#8217;s population density makes its situation exponentially more difficult.</p>\n<p>A World Bank study in 2014 found that environmental degradation like air pollution, water pollution, deforestation and natural disasters cost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/india\" class=\" u-underline\">India</a> $80bn per year, or nearly 6% of its economic activity. Of that total, 52% is attributable to air pollution.</p>\n<p>If you thought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/feb/25/air-pollution-in-china-in-pictures\" class=\" u-underline\">China&#8217;s smog was bad</a>, Delhi&#8217;s air pollution levels can be <a href=\"http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/you-think-the-air-in-beijing-is-bad-try-new-delhi\" class=\" u-underline\">twice as high</a>, with even less government action to show for it. India&#8217;s air pollution is not only far worse than any of the other BRICs, it is so intense that it is reducing plants&#8217; ability to photosynthesize sunlight, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/03/india-air-pollution-cutting-crop-yields-by-almost-half\" class=\" u-underline\">cutting crop yields in half</a>.</p>\n<p>While pollution is a broad problem across India, poverty and general lack of access to basic human needs is more of a first order problem, and one that draws the lion&#8217;s share of attention from government, businesses and people. In 2012, just 36% of India&#8217;s population had <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.ACSN/countries/IN-CN-RU-BR?display=graph\" class=\" u-underline\">access to improved sanitation</a>, leading the nation&#8217;s minister of rural development to call India &#8220;the <a href=\"http://ibnlive.in.com/news/indian-railway-worlds-biggest-open-toilet-jairam-ramesh/275108-3.html\" class=\" u-underline\">world&#8217;s capital for open defecations</a>&#8221;.</p>\n<p>As a result, much of the sustainable development discussion in India has focused on inclusion and bringing the population into the 21st century. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-launches-my-clean-india-campaign/article6468047.ece?topicpage=true&amp;topicId=1813\" class=\" u-underline\">launched the Clean India Mission</a>, a five-year effort to eliminate open defecation, provide access to improved sanitation, and clean up the River Ganges, among other targets. Corporations have joined up with the Clean India Mission, committing to invest in <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/PMs-clean-India-initiative-TCS-pledges-Rs-100-crore-for-toilets-for-girls-across-10000-schools/articleshow/40364881.cms\" class=\" u-underline\">education for girls</a> and <a href=\"http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-chanda-kochhar-icici-chief-clean-india-mission/1/212238.html\" class=\" u-underline\">adopting communities</a> for cleanup, among others.</p>\n<p>Domestic and multinational corporations have been important partners for a range of India&#8217;s sustainable development efforts, although most of these business efforts tend to be <a href=\"http://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/blog-view/navigating-new-terrain-in-emerging-markets-brazil-china-and-india\" class=\" u-underline\">focused locally or regionally</a>. </p>\n<p>But in 2013, India became the first country in the world to mandate corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, with a world-leading corporate law that requires <a href=\"http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-09-05/news/41803586_1_csr-corporate-social-responsibility-india-inc\" class=\" u-underline\">about 8,000 companies</a> in India to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/india-csr-law-debate-business-ngo\" class=\" u-underline\">invest 2% of its profits</a> per year on CSR programs. The resulting investment could mean as much as $2bn per year will be invested in poverty reduction, environmental and social programs. The law similarly emphasizes that companies invest in areas <a href=\"http://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/blog-view/india-companies-act-2013-five-key-points-about-indias-csr-mandate\" class=\" u-underline\">local to its operations</a>.</p>\n\n<p> Related: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/04/brazil-china-russia-india-climate-change-labor-economy-sustainability\" class=\" u-underline\">The BRIC nations' response to climate change is critical to the fate of the planet</a> </p>\n\n<p>Plenty of debate remains about the current and future impacts of India&#8217;s CSR law and whether it will end up being a net good for the nation or simply result in check-the-box CSR practices. </p>\n<p>But one aspect of the law stipulates that the investments can not be <a href=\"http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/307596/Corporate+Governance/Indias+New+Corporate+Social+Responsibility+Requirements+Beware+of+the+Pitfalls\" class=\" u-underline\">part of the company&#8217;s normal operations</a>, or solely benefit of the company&#8217;s employees. This condition could potentially prevent companies from investing in projects with both business and community benefits &#8211; such as switching from coal to renewable energy.</p>\n<p>Even if the CSR law doesn&#8217;t spur investment in energy efficiency or green building, some companies are taking that step on their own, and are trying to spread the word about the many business benefits. </p>\n<p>Information technology company Infosys pioneered an effort in 2014 to raise the profile of green building technologies among Indian firms. When it undertook an expansion of its campus in Hyderabad, the company built one to traditional standards and one with energy efficiency at its core. The resulting green building, which earned Leed Platinum certification, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/28/infosys-hyderabad-experiment-green-buildings-energy-efficiency-india\" class=\" u-underline\">uses 38% less energy</a> than its counterpart, and cost 1% less to build.</p>\n<p>Building green as India expands is one example of the leapfrogging potential that all developing economies can benefit from.
