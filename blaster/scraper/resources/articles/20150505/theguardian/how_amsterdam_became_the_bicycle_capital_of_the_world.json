One by one, other cities followed suit.\n\nNowadays the Netherlands boasts 22,000 miles of cycle paths. More than a quarter of all trips are made by bicycle, compared with 2% in the UK \u2013 and this rises to 38% in Amsterdam and 59% in the university city of Groningen. All major Dutch cities have designated \u201cbicycle civil servants\u201d, tasked to maintain and improve the network. And the popularity of the bike is still growing, thanks partly to the development of electric bicycles.\n\nThe Cyclists\u2019 Union has long ceased to be a group of random activists; it is now a respectable organisation with 34,000 paying members whose expertise is in worldwide demand.\n\nRelated: End of the car age: how cities are outgrowing the automobile\n\n\u201cWe have achieved a lot, but we\u2019re facing many new challenges,\u201d says their spokesman, Wim Bot. \u201cMany old cycle paths need to be reconstructed because they do not measure up to our modern standards \u2013 some are used by so many people that they are no longer wide enough. We have the problem of parking all those bikes, and we are thinking of new ways to create even more space for cyclists and pedestrians. What our cities really need is a totally new kind of infrastructure. They\u2019re simply not fit for so much car traffic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe battle goes on,\u201d says Godefrooij. \u201cThe propensity of urban planners to give priority to cars is still persistent. It\u2019s easy to understand: an extra tunnel for cyclists means you have to spend extra money on the project. We\u2019ve come a long way, but we can never lower our guard.\u201d",
