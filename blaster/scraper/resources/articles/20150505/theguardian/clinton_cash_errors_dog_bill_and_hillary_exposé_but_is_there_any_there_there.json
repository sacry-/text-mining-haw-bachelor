He was accused of corruption of money and corruption of power, but nothing was ever found. Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater: everybody was digging deeply but as one Clinton aide put it &#8216;there was no there there&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But now that Clinton Cash has finally been published, and the American voting public can read it for themselves, the question remains: this time round is there any &#8220;there, there&#8221;? While some of the boldest claims in the book have been shown to be erroneous or unsubstantiated, does the charge that the Clintons exposed themselves to real or perceived conflicts of interests stand up?</p>\n<p>Certainly, pundits were warning about the problem of the large sums of money flowing into the Clinton Foundation&#8217;s coffers even before Hillary Clinton took up her position as Obama&#8217;s global emissary-in-chief. A month before she became secretary of state,<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/20/AR2008122001647.html\" class=\" u-underline\"> the Washington Post warned</a> in an editorial that her husband&#8217;s fundraising activities were problematic. &#8220;Even if Ms Clinton is not influenced by gifts to her husband&#8217;s charity, the appearance of conflict is unavoidable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since the foundation was formed in 2001, some $2bn has been donated, mainly in big lump sums. Fully a third of the donors giving more than $1m, and more than a half of those handing over more than $5m, have been foreign governments, corporations or tycoons. (The foundation stresses that such largesse has been put to very good use &#8211; fighting obesity around the globe, combating climate change, helping millions of people with HIV/Aids obtain antiretroviral drugs at affordable prices.) </p>\n<p>Schweizer may have made mistakes about aspects of Bill Clinton&#8217;s fees on the speaker circuit, but one of his main contentions &#8211; that the former president&#8217;s rates skyrocketed after his wife became secretary of state &#8211; is correct. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/26/peter-schweizer/fact-checking-clinton-cash-author-claim-about-bill/\" class=\" u-underline\">Politifact confirmed</a> that since leaving the White House in 2001 and 2013, Bill Clinton made 13 speeches for which he commanded more than $500,000; all but two of those mega-money earners occurred in the period when Hillary was at the State Department.</p>\n<p>Though Schweizer has failed to prove actual corruption in the arrangement &#8211; at no point in the book does he produce evidence showing that Bill&#8217;s exorbitant speaker fees were directly tied to policy concessions from Hillary &#8211; he does point to several glaring conflicts of interest. Bill Clinton did accept large speaker fees accumulating to more than $1m from TD Bank, a major shareholder in the Keystone XL pipeline, at precisely the time that the Obama administration, and Hillary Clinton within it, was wrestling with the vexed issue of whether to approve it.</p>\n<p>It is also true that large donations to the foundation from the chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, at around the time of the Russian purchase of the company and while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, were never disclosed to the public. The multimillion sums were channeled through a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation, CGSCI, which did not reveal its individual donors.</p>\n<p>Such awkward collisions between Bill&#8217;s fundraising activities and Hillary&#8217;s public service have raised concerns not just among those who might be dismissed as part of a vast rightwing conspiracy. Take Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham university who has written extensively on political corruption in the US.</p>\n<p>Teachout, who last year stood against Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic party nomination for New York governor, points out that you don&#8217;t have to be able to prove quid pro quo for alarm bells to ring. &#8220;Our whole system of rules is built upon the concept that you must prevent conflicts of interests if you are to resist corruption in its many forms. Conflicts like that can infect us in ways we don&#8217;t even see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teachout said that the Clintons presented the US political world with a totally new challenge. &#8220;We have never had somebody running for president whose spouse &#8211; himself a former president &#8211; is running around the world raising money in these vast sums.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/us-news/2015/may/05/clinton-cash-bill-hillary-scandal-book#img-4\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430847800203/b3ceee31-23df-4d2c-a443-cb077cbed0d2-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill and Hillary Clinton\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485z4%2Fsfb%23img-4&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Clinton+Cash%3A+errors+dog+Bill+and+Hillary+expos%C3%A9+%E2%80%93+but+is+there+any+%27there%27+there%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485z4%2Fstw%23img-4\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Clinton+Cash%3A+errors+dog+Bill+and+Hillary+expos%C3%A9+%E2%80%93+but+is+there+any+%27there%27+there%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2015%2Fmay%2F05%2Fclinton-cash-bill-hillary-scandal-book&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F5%2F1430847800842%2Fb3ceee31-23df-4d2c-a443-cb077cbed0d2-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nHillary and Bill Clinton in 2008.

They say that a family in which one member is vying for the most powerful office on Earth must avoid straying into even the unintentionally inappropriate.</p>\n<p>In the wake of Clinton Cash, the foundation has admitted that it <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/blog/2015/04/26/commitment-honesty-transparency-and-accountability\" class=\" u-underline\">made mistakes</a> in disclosing some of its contributions. It has also implemented <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/04/15/clinton-foundation-to-restrict-foreign-donations/\" class=\" u-underline\">new rules</a> that will see its financial reporting increase from once annually to four times a year, while large donations from foreign governments will be limited in future to six countries including the UK and Germany.</p>\n<p>But with Bill refusing doggedly to give up his speaker engagements &#8211; &#8220;I gotta pay our bills&#8221; &#8211; and foreign corporations and super-rich individuals still able to donate to the family charity, it looks like this controversy may run and run. Politically, too, Hillary Clinton is confronted with a potential credibility gap between her appeal to ordinary Americans on the presidential campaign trail and the millions that continue to flow to the foundation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is she going to be in touch with the needs and dreams of poor America when her spouse and daughter are working with the world&#8217;s global elite?&#8221; said Dave Levinthal of the anti-corruption investigative organization, the Center for Public Integrity. &#8220;That&#8217;s a question she will have to answer, every step of the way.&#8221;</p>\n</div>",

Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater: everybody was digging deeply but as one Clinton aide put it \u2018there was no there there\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut now that Clinton Cash has finally been published, and the American voting public can read it for themselves, the question remains: this time round is there any \u201cthere, there\u201d? While some of the boldest claims in the book have been shown to be erroneous or unsubstantiated, does the charge that the Clintons exposed themselves to real or perceived conflicts of interests stand up?\n\nCertainly, pundits were warning about the problem of the large sums of money flowing into the Clinton Foundation\u2019s coffers even before Hillary Clinton took up her position as Obama\u2019s global emissary-in-chief. A month before she became secretary of state, the Washington Post warned in an editorial that her husband\u2019s fundraising activities were problematic. \u201cEven if Ms Clinton is not influenced by gifts to her husband\u2019s charity, the appearance of conflict is unavoidable.\u201d\n\nSince the foundation was formed in 2001, some $2bn has been donated, mainly in big lump sums. Fully a third of the donors giving more than $1m, and more than a half of those handing over more than $5m, have been foreign governments, corporations or tycoons. (The foundation stresses that such largesse has been put to very good use \u2013 fighting obesity around the globe, combating climate change, helping millions of people with HIV/Aids obtain antiretroviral drugs at affordable prices.)\n\nSchweizer may have made mistakes about aspects of Bill Clinton\u2019s fees on the speaker circuit, but one of his main contentions \u2013 that the former president\u2019s rates skyrocketed after his wife became secretary of state \u2013 is correct. Politifact confirmed that since leaving the White House in 2001 and 2013, Bill Clinton made 13 speeches for which he commanded more than $500,000; all but two of those mega-money earners occurred in the period when Hillary was at the State Department.\n\nThough Schweizer has failed to prove actual corruption in the arrangement \u2013 at no point in the book does he produce evidence showing that Bill\u2019s exorbitant speaker fees were directly tied to policy concessions from Hillary \u2013 he does point to several glaring conflicts of interest. Bill Clinton did accept large speaker fees accumulating to more than $1m from TD Bank, a major shareholder in the Keystone XL pipeline, at precisely the time that the Obama administration, and Hillary Clinton within it, was wrestling with the vexed issue of whether to approve it.\n\nIt is also true that large donations to the foundation from the chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, at around the time of the Russian purchase of the company and while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, were never disclosed to the public. The multimillion sums were channeled through a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation, CGSCI, which did not reveal its individual donors.\n\nSuch awkward collisions between Bill\u2019s fundraising activities and Hillary\u2019s public service have raised concerns not just among those who might be dismissed as part of a vast rightwing conspiracy. Take Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham university who has written extensively on political corruption in the US.\n\nTeachout, who last year stood against Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic party nomination for New York governor, points out that you don\u2019t have to be able to prove quid pro quo for alarm bells to ring. \u201cOur whole system of rules is built upon the concept that you must prevent conflicts of interests if you are to resist corruption in its many forms. Conflicts like that can infect us in ways we don\u2019t even see.\u201d\n\nTeachout said that the Clintons presented the US political world with a totally new challenge. \u201cWe have never had somebody running for president whose spouse \u2013 himself a former president \u2013 is running around the world raising money in these vast sums.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hillary and Bill Clinton in 2008.

They say that a family in which one member is vying for the most powerful office on Earth must avoid straying into even the unintentionally inappropriate.\n\nIn the wake of Clinton Cash, the foundation has admitted that it made mistakes in disclosing some of its contributions. It has also implemented new rules that will see its financial reporting increase from once annually to four times a year, while large donations from foreign governments will be limited in future to six countries including the UK and Germany.\n\nBut with Bill refusing doggedly to give up his speaker engagements \u2013 \u201cI gotta pay our bills\u201d \u2013 and foreign corporations and super-rich individuals still able to donate to the family charity, it looks like this controversy may run and run. Politically, too, Hillary Clinton is confronted with a potential credibility gap between her appeal to ordinary Americans on the presidential campaign trail and the millions that continue to flow to the foundation.\n\n\u201cIs she going to be in touch with the needs and dreams of poor America when her spouse and daughter are working with the world\u2019s global elite?\u201d said Dave Levinthal of the anti-corruption investigative organization, the Center for Public Integrity. \u201cThat\u2019s a question she will have to answer, every step of the way.\u201d",
