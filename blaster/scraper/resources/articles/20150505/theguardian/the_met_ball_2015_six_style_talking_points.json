  "article_html": "<div><h2>Did anyone dress offensively?</h2>\n<p>The big question hanging over the Met Ball&#8217;s red carpet ahead of the event was: how much guests would embrace this year&#8217;s Chinese theme and who would cross the line into offensive sartorial stereotype dressing. Each year, the Costume Institute Gala has a focus, and sometimes a dress code, based around the exhibition. This year there were no rules and red carpet watchers braced themselves for a car crash of cultural appropriation. In the main this didn&#8217;t happen. &#8220;China: through the looking glass&#8221; inspired twists on Chinese dressing &#8211; designer cheongsam, headgear and gowns in auspicious yellow all made an appearance. Sarah Jessica Parker&#8217;s headpiece by Philip Treacy was arguably too close to the stereotyping bone. Her flaming-red number was more dragon costume than chic, despite the actor having form for extravagant headdress on the red carpet. SJP claimed that the real story was her dress which she helped design with the H&amp;M Conscious collection (not buying that, sorry). The internet disagreed, and christened the headdress a homage to Heat Miser. Meanwhile what Rihanna&#8217;s dress lacked in taste in one sense, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/05/how-to-make-rihannas-met-ball-dress-stylewatch\" class=\" u-underline\">&#8220;cheese omelette&#8221; gown</a> made up for it in another.
