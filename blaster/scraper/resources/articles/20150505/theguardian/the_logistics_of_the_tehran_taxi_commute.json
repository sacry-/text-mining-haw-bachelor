Taxis following such routes might park at hotspots known to public transport junkies. Drivers step out for a few minutes to yell out first their destination and then how many more passengers are needed to fill up the car, as in &#8220;Azadi, one person&#8221;.

This can be particularly helpful when you&#8217;re coming back from a party at 3am and aren&#8217;t in the mood for some private taxi agency&#8217;s skewed notion of late-night surge pricing. But it also might mean standing at an intersection for half-an-hour until you find a match. </p>\n<p>Granted, buses and the metro are cheaper than the shared taxi. A ride on the BRT, a rapid bus line that cuts through the city, costs 3,500 rials on average (&#163;0.07, $0.10), and a metro ride will set you back 6,000. But even people who take traditional public transport might have to hail a shared cab at some point because buses and the metro do have blind spots in a city that sprawls like Tehran (the city&#8217;s constantly expanding metro is still nowhere near as expansive as Tokyo or New York&#8217;s).</p>\n<p>Most of the shared taxi rides you&#8217;ll take will cost at least 10,000 rials, and people usually combine a few - let&#8217;s say two - 10,000 rial routes to get to work. The same applies on the way back from work. If we assume a middle-class income hovers somewhere around 10,000,000 rials a month, this means forking over something like 900,000 - or 9% - of your monthly earnings just to get to and from your workplace. </p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s something magical about riding shotgun in a shared taxi and revelling in the cheap upholstered fabric of the passenger seat. It can fend off a Case of the Mondays (even though the workweek in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\" class=\" u-underline\">Iran</a> starts on Saturday). Yes, nabbing the front seat means getting in and getting off without having to worry about letting others out.</p>\n<p>Though, if you get shafted with the backseat, it might mean exchanging sinister glances to win a few extra inches of legroom or running the risk of being pummelled by elbows and briefcases. Sometimes, unless you sit by the child-locked left backseat door, you&#8217;ll be repeatedly bothered to scooch out of the car to let others off (advice: pull out your headphones). And if you&#8217;re in a Paykan - an Iranian-made 1967 Hillman Hunter that hasn&#8217;t been in production for years - your morning commute will be invaded by mysterious exhaust fumes seeping into the car&#8217;s interior. No one will muster the courage to point this out.</p>\n<p>It will take a while to learn the ropes. But once you&#8217;ve embarrassed yourself enough times by yelling out far-flung destinations that no one&#8217;s headed towards, and learned where which shared-taxis gather, you&#8217;ll have figured out your daily commute. Just don&#8217;t thrust your thumb forward - it&#8217;s Iran&#8217;s equivalent of the middle finger. </p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/world/iran-blog/2015/may/05/tehran-iran-taxis-transport#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/2/1430593191397/df5ce8ad-7a23-4acf-aa48-7a8ea82ecfaf-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"Tehran taxi terminal \" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F482nj%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+logistics+of+the+Tehran+taxi+commute&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F482nj%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The+logistics+of+the+Tehran+taxi+commute&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2Firan-blog%2F2015%2Fmay%2F05%2Ftehran-iran-taxis-transport&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F2%2F1430593191928%2F594a0ccf-50d8-4292-a45f-4d3095226f79-1020x765.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nA taxi terminal in Tehran, Iran Photograph: Tehran Bureau\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a real stickler, you can make sure to travel with licensed cabbies, who drive either yellow or green cars or have an official-looking sticker on their windshield.
