  "article_html": "<div><p>We&#8217;re now well versed in the concept of the retro revival. But while most revivals have roots in a specific era &#8211; the mod subculture, for example, with its reverence for early-60s pop and fashion &#8211; we&#8217;re currently in thrall to a much more slippery concept. &#8220;Old school&#8221; is as much as state of mind as a musical movement or style aesthetic, and it is firmly back in the modern lexicon, applied to everything from sunglasses to compilations of 1980s rave tracks; from vintage motorbikes to the name of <a href=\"http://www.oldskoolcafe.org/about-us\" class=\" u-underline\">a not-for-profit cafe in San Francisco</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your old school could be Debbie Harry circa Rapture in 1981. It could be Kanye West&#8217;s 2004 debut, The College Dropout. Or, I&#8217;m told by a reliable authority, 1995&#8217;s Bombscare by rave outfit 2 Bad Mice. Personally, my old school is hip-hop in New York in the early to mid 1980s; <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/photography/gallery/19428/0/jamel-shabazz\" class=\" u-underline\">kids photographed by Jamel Shabazz</a> wearing Adidas tracksuits, Kangol hats, Cazal shades and Farrah Fawcett waves on subway trains covered in graffiti; records like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYMkEMCHtJ4\" class=\" u-underline\">The Message by Grandmaster Flash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh1AypBaIEk\" class=\" u-underline\">Afrika Bambaataa&#8217;s Planet Rock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA8DsUN6g_k\" class=\" u-underline\">Run DMC&#8217;s My Adidas</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s this look, feeling and sound that&#8217;s currently enjoying a bit of a revival. Adidas&#8217;s successful relaunch of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/06/are-adidas-superstars-set-to-be-the-new-stan-smiths\" class=\" u-underline\">Stan Smith tennis shoe has paved the way for the return of the Superstar</a> &#8211; the shell-toe trainer to which rappers Run DMC once paid homage. Vans&#8217; Old Skool sneaker, the one with the squiggle down the side, is also back in vogue, along with the bucket hat &#8211; popularised by rapper LL Cool J in the 80s and <a href=\"http://www.papermag.com/2015/03/melissa_forde_rihanna_bucket_hat_opening_ceremony.php\" class=\" u-underline\">currently modelled by Rihanna</a>.</p>\n<p>Away from hip-hop, dance music&#8217;s old school is also going strong. The term is applied to everything from rave culture to drum&#8217;n&#8217;bass and garage, typically partnered with graphics utilising the kind of smiley face that predates the emoji keyboard. Anyone who lives in a large British city will be familiar with the cardboard signs strapped to traffic lights advertising old-school warehouse parties &#8220;going back&#8221; to years including 1995, 1998 and 2000. In mid-April, <a href=\"http://www.ministryofsound.com/music/compilations/throwback-old-skool-anthems#uzjwYwZMWIH8weFm.97\" class=\" u-underline\">Throwback: Old Skool Anthems</a>, a Ministry of Sound compilation of garage from the turn of the century, was No 1 in the dance chart, leapfrogging the Prodigy. The opening track? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEtWdI9FByA\" class=\" u-underline\">Re-Rewind by the Artful Dodger, aptly enough</a>.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/culture/2015/may/05/old-school-80s-hip-hop-adidas-rave-drumnbass-kanye-west-2004-album#img-1\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430843143716/e7dde8c1-1b06-470c-984d-0c559578f22f-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"The early days of rave.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485f8%2Fsfb%23img-1&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Back+to+the+old+school+%E2%80%93+but+when+was+that+again%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485f8%2Fstw%23img-1\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Back+to+the+old+school+%E2%80%93+but+when+was+that+again%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fculture%2F2015%2Fmay%2F05%2Fold-school-80s-hip-hop-adidas-rave-drumnbass-kanye-west-2004-album&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F5%2F1430843144317%2Fe7dde8c1-1b06-470c-984d-0c559578f22f-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nThe early days of rave. Photograph: PYMCA/REX Shutterstock\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever old school was &#8211; 1979? 1988? 2000? &#8211; it fits into our obsession with the recent past, or, at least, our edited version of it. Retro pervades pop culture, turning up in everything from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/24/taylor-swift-1989-review\" class=\" u-underline\">Taylor Swift&#8217;s album 1989</a>, to Instagram&#8217;s 1977 filter, <a href=\"http://www.tweedrun.com/\" class=\" u-underline\">the Tweed Run</a> (a 1940s-style &#8220;metropolitan bicycle ride&#8221; in London where &#8220;tweed suits, plus fours, bowties, and jaunty flat caps are all encouraged&#8221;), the steampunk scene (Victoriana meets 1950s sci-fi), Mom jeans (late 1980s), <a href=\"http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2014/10/photo-jack-wilshere-shows-off-new-haircut-ahead-of-arsenal-clash/\" class=\" u-underline\">Jack Wilshere&#8217;s haircut</a> (1950s) and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/10/too-cool-for-school-saint-laurents-signature-look-is-out-in-force\" class=\" u-underline\">Saint Laurent catwalk</a> (1985, this season). Unlike the pin-neat three-button mod revival, say, these days, it&#8217;s not about slavishly recreating an era &#8211; it&#8217;s more like adding the sepia filter of the past to our modern experiences. A teenager might want to channel Mick Jagger in 1964 but he&#8217;ll need the iPhone and selfie stick to document the look. In this context, the amorphous nature of old school is all the more appealing; you can choose your own throwback.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/culture/2015/may/05/old-school-80s-hip-hop-adidas-rave-drumnbass-kanye-west-2004-album#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430842478344/3534727f-9647-4d36-bd93-19aa1a6898bb-320x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Mid-90s hip-hop club culture.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485f8%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Back+to+the+old+school+%E2%80%93+but+when+was+that+again%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485f8%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Back+to+the+old+school+%E2%80%93+but+when+was+that+again%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fculture%2F2015%2Fmay%2F05%2Fold-school-80s-hip-hop-adidas-rave-drumnbass-kanye-west-2004-album&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F5%2F1430842479472%2F3534727f-9647-4d36-bd93-19aa1a6898bb-1360x2040.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nMid-90s hip-hop club culture. Photograph: PYMCA/REX Shutterstock\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re buying into the legend of those times and it is more seductive because you weren&#8217;t there,&#8221; says Simon Reynolds (old school: &#8220;1992&#8221;), author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/29/retromania-simon-reynolds-review\" class=\" u-underline\">Retromania, the 2011 book about &#8220;pop culture&#8217;s addiction to its own past&#8221;</a>. &#8220;That&#8217;s the best thing about vicarious nostalgia &#8211; you get to enjoy the 1970s without the strikes; you can just cream off glam rock. And those moments only become more burnished as time goes by.&#8221; This works with my idea of old school: I didn&#8217;t have to experience the poverty and cocaine epidemic in New York&#8217;s outer boroughs in the late 1970s &#8211; I can just listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFQzSJCs_ss\" class=\" u-underline\">Grandmaster Melle Mel&#8217;s White Lines.</a></p>\n<p>Whenever you time-stamp it, the idea of old school is tied up with search for authenticity, to find the &#8220;real&#8221; thing, the original. Vans advertise their Old Skool trainers with the strapline &#8220;Be the original&#8221;, while <a href=\"http://www.adidas.co.uk/shoes-pharrell\" class=\" u-underline\">Pharrell&#8217;s multicoloured Superstars are part of Adidas&#8217;s Original range</a>. <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=old+skool\" class=\" u-underline\">The Urban Dictionary</a> says the term was &#8220;derived from &#8216;old is kool&#8217;, becoming &#8216;old&#8217;s kool&#8217; and then becoming &#8216;old skool&#8217; meaning old is cool.&#8221; The original, old-school way of doing things, is, almost by definition, something to be admired. &#8220;It suggests respect and authenticity,&#8221; says Erik Nielson, a specialist in African-American hip-hop culture at the University of Richmond (old school: &#8220;late 1970s&#8221;). &#8220;The implicit connotation is that the present is a degraded version of the past.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These days, slow-moving pre-Google pop culture feels purer, childlike and innocent &#8211; uncorrupted by the mainstream. According to Reynolds, old school as a term suggests &#8220;a semi-conscious harking back to the schoolyard fun you had as kids. ... something fun, innocent and fresh.&#8221; This makes particular sense in the case of hip-hop. In the 1970s, it was a small subculture found exclusively in an area of the Bronx seven miles across; by 1999, it was the top-selling musical genre in the US. The old-school hip-hop era has allure now because it was one of the last subcultures given the space and time to develop before the rest of the world saw it. &#8220;What really defined that era was the culture of hip-hop,&#8221; says Travis Gosa, associate professor of Africana studies at Cornell University (old school: &#8220;before 1986&#8221;). &#8220;It was about more than rapping: it was fashion, language, how you carried yourself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The pivotal year, when hip-hop went overground, was perhaps 1988, when <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/35643246\" class=\" u-underline\">Yo! MTV Raps</a> aired and beamed it across middle America. Nelson George (old school: &#8220;before 1985&#8221;), a hip-hop commentator since the genre&#8217;s infancy, remembers first hearing the term &#8220;in the 1990s when the west-coast scene was happening and there was a sense of eras passing&#8221;. Old-school hip-hop &#8211; the pre-commercial world of block parties, breakdancing, graffiti &#8211; was no longer living and breathing by then. It had began to be embalmed: preserved for future generations to discover. </p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/culture/2015/may/05/old-school-80s-hip-hop-adidas-rave-drumnbass-kanye-west-2004-album#img-3\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430842581922/6eff0cea-c3d6-4a8e-9d99-21ed4a09a6d7-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"With a debut album released in 2004, even Kanye West can be considered old school.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485f8%2Fsfb%23img-3&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Back+to+the+old+school+%E2%80%93+but+when+was+that+again%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F485f8%2Fstw%23img-3\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Back+to+the+old+school+%E2%80%93+but+when+was+that+again%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fculture%2F2015%2Fmay%2F05%2Fold-school-80s-hip-hop-adidas-rave-drumnbass-kanye-west-2004-album&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F5%2F1430842582476%2F6eff0cea-c3d6-4a8e-9d99-21ed4a09a6d7-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nWith a debut album released in 2004, even Kanye West can be considered old school. Photograph: Grand/Gary Calton\n\n\n\n<p>George puts the concept of old school in a longer tradition that involves fans&#8217; &#8220;instinct to capture the essence of black music&#8221; and suggests it has more cultural power outside of the US. &#8220;Around the world, the interest in hip-hop centres on authenticity and purity,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s not unusual in African-American music &#8211; it happened with blues, jazz and soul.&#8221; He namechecks <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/northern-soul-where-have-all-the-style-tribes-gone-9807056.html\" class=\" u-underline\">northern soul: the 1970s scene</a> in which largely white working-class Brits repurposed obscure 1960s R&amp;B records for their party music.</p>\n<p>As George suggests, the 1990s was the last time old school captured the zeitgeist, when Kate Moss wore Samba trainers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLGWQfK-6DY\" class=\" u-underline\">Run DMC&#8217;s It&#8217;s Like That was back in the charts</a> thanks to a remix by Jason Nevins and a breakdancing video.

It was almost a code, a symbol of someone like-minded, worn with other signifiers like <a href=\"http://www.shopstyle.co.uk/browse?fts=puma+clyde+trainers\" class=\" u-underline\">Puma Clyde trainers</a>, leather tracksuits and Vans. &#8220;All these items were really underground, insignificant unless you knew,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s what this T-shirt is. It&#8217;s looking back to a time before things got commercial, mass.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p class=\"embed-video-wrapper u-responsive-ratio u-responsive-ratio--hd\">\n\n</p>\n\nYo! MTV Raps pinpoints when underground hip-hop went overground.\n\n\n<p>The 1990s was when the concept of old school began to take hold in dance music, too &#8211; despite the fact that the sound being so wistfully recalled was ridiculously recent. Reynolds marvels at this shift. &#8220;All genres reach a midlife crisis, when the early days start to look better than the present,&#8221; he writes in Retromania. &#8220;Sure enough, around 1996, you started to hear talk about &#8216;old-school hardcore&#8217;: veterans waxing wistfully for a golden age of rave only four years earlier.&#8221; Almost 20 years later, records from the early 1990s are still played at old-school nights attended by those who were there first time around, and twentysomethings who weren&#8217;t even born.</p>\n<p>For many of the generation who grew up in the 1990s, though, the meaning of old school has shifted again. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/jun/12/hip-hop-fashion-astrid-andersen-asap-ferg-topman\" class=\" u-underline\">Astrid Andersen, a 29-year-old London Fashion Week menswear designer</a> (old school: &#8220;1996&#8221;), whose clothes are worn by musicians including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/asap-rocky\" class=\" u-underline\">A$AP Rocky</a> and Wiz Khalifa, namechecks &#8220;Puffy, TLC, Wu-Tang Clan and Missy Elliott&#8221; as her old-school references. &#8220;The scene then was so brave,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It was like they discovered a whole new universe.

Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/REX Shutterstock/Jonathan Hordle/REX Shutterstock\n\n\n\n<p>George is sanguine about the shifting of the old-school goalposts: &#8220;Every generation uses these phrases for their own purposes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is not a term for purists, anyway. Old school&#8217;s fluid nature plays into our desire to throw a lot of references together to see what sticks, and Semtex suggests that&#8217;s part of the appeal for 1Xtra&#8217;s 15- to 24-year-old core listeners: &#8220;People are rediscovering [Air] Jordans, tracksuits, but they&#8217;re doing something new with them,&#8221; he says. Loren Platt (old school: &#8220;early 1980s&#8221;), the 31-year-old co-founder of 90s R&amp;B night Work It, agrees: &#8220;It&#8217;s about taking references from the past and regurgitating them, making them better than the first time,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We recalled the 1990s but only the bits we liked, then cut and pasted it to make something new &#8230; referencing like that now is part of youth culture.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fergus Purcell (old school: &#8220;late 1970s&#8221;), a graphic designer who works with <a href=\"http://shop.palaceskateboards.com/\" class=\" u-underline\">brands from Palace</a> to Marc by Marc Jacobs, and his own label Aries, saw the first old-school wave in skate culture in the 1990s. He says our current pick-and-mix approach has its roots in that. &#8220;Culturally, back then hip-hop represented all music in one. It was futuristic and fantastic,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been catching up with that idea of taking every source and aesthetic style. <a href=\"http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/designers_profile.aspx?DesignerID=2159\" class=\" u-underline\">Ashley Williams</a> [fashion designer and Purcell collaborator] is someone who effortlessly channels that, but not as a distinct obsession: it&#8217;s part of a menu to draw on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Purcell argues that, while old school is currently riding a wave, it &#8220;hasn&#8217;t ever gone away. For the past 15 years, I feel culture has been blurred &#8211; there are no starts and ends to movements any more.&#8221;</p>\n</div>",

  "text": "We\u2019re now well versed in the concept of the retro revival. But while most revivals have roots in a specific era \u2013 the mod subculture, for example, with its reverence for early-60s pop and fashion \u2013 we\u2019re currently in thrall to a much more slippery concept. \u201cOld school\u201d is as much as state of mind as a musical movement or style aesthetic, and it is firmly back in the modern lexicon, applied to everything from sunglasses to compilations of 1980s rave tracks; from vintage motorbikes to the name of a not-for-profit cafe in San Francisco.\n\nYour old school could be Debbie Harry circa Rapture in 1981. It could be Kanye West\u2019s 2004 debut, The College Dropout. Or, I\u2019m told by a reliable authority, 1995\u2019s Bombscare by rave outfit 2 Bad Mice. Personally, my old school is hip-hop in New York in the early to mid 1980s; kids photographed by Jamel Shabazz wearing Adidas tracksuits, Kangol hats, Cazal shades and Farrah Fawcett waves on subway trains covered in graffiti; records like The Message by Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa\u2019s Planet Rock and Run DMC\u2019s My Adidas.\n\nIt\u2019s this look, feeling and sound that\u2019s currently enjoying a bit of a revival. Adidas\u2019s successful relaunch of the Stan Smith tennis shoe has paved the way for the return of the Superstar \u2013 the shell-toe trainer to which rappers Run DMC once paid homage. Vans\u2019 Old Skool sneaker, the one with the squiggle down the side, is also back in vogue, along with the bucket hat \u2013 popularised by rapper LL Cool J in the 80s and currently modelled by Rihanna.\n\nAway from hip-hop, dance music\u2019s old school is also going strong. The term is applied to everything from rave culture to drum\u2019n\u2019bass and garage, typically partnered with graphics utilising the kind of smiley face that predates the emoji keyboard. Anyone who lives in a large British city will be familiar with the cardboard signs strapped to traffic lights advertising old-school warehouse parties \u201cgoing back\u201d to years including 1995, 1998 and 2000. In mid-April, Throwback: Old Skool Anthems, a Ministry of Sound compilation of garage from the turn of the century, was No 1 in the dance chart, leapfrogging the Prodigy. The opening track? Re-Rewind by the Artful Dodger, aptly enough.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The early days of rave. Photograph: PYMCA/REX Shutterstock\n\nWhenever old school was \u2013 1979? 1988? 2000? \u2013 it fits into our obsession with the recent past, or, at least, our edited version of it. Retro pervades pop culture, turning up in everything from Taylor Swift\u2019s album 1989, to Instagram\u2019s 1977 filter, the Tweed Run (a 1940s-style \u201cmetropolitan bicycle ride\u201d in London where \u201ctweed suits, plus fours, bowties, and jaunty flat caps are all encouraged\u201d), the steampunk scene (Victoriana meets 1950s sci-fi), Mom jeans (late 1980s), Jack Wilshere\u2019s haircut (1950s) and the Saint Laurent catwalk (1985, this season). Unlike the pin-neat three-button mod revival, say, these days, it\u2019s not about slavishly recreating an era \u2013 it\u2019s more like adding the sepia filter of the past to our modern experiences. A teenager might want to channel Mick Jagger in 1964 but he\u2019ll need the iPhone and selfie stick to document the look. In this context, the amorphous nature of old school is all the more appealing; you can choose your own throwback.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mid-90s hip-hop club culture. Photograph: PYMCA/REX Shutterstock\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re buying into the legend of those times and it is more seductive because you weren\u2019t there,\u201d says Simon Reynolds (old school: \u201c1992\u201d), author of Retromania, the 2011 book about \u201cpop culture\u2019s addiction to its own past\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing about vicarious nostalgia \u2013 you get to enjoy the 1970s without the strikes; you can just cream off glam rock. And those moments only become more burnished as time goes by.\u201d This works with my idea of old school: I didn\u2019t have to experience the poverty and cocaine epidemic in New York\u2019s outer boroughs in the late 1970s \u2013 I can just listen to Grandmaster Melle Mel\u2019s White Lines.\n\nWhenever you time-stamp it, the idea of old school is tied up with search for authenticity, to find the \u201creal\u201d thing, the original. Vans advertise their Old Skool trainers with the strapline \u201cBe the original\u201d, while Pharrell\u2019s multicoloured Superstars are part of Adidas\u2019s Original range. The Urban Dictionary says the term was \u201cderived from \u2018old is kool\u2019, becoming \u2018old\u2019s kool\u2019 and then becoming \u2018old skool\u2019 meaning old is cool.\u201d The original, old-school way of doing things, is, almost by definition, something to be admired. \u201cIt suggests respect and authenticity,\u201d says Erik Nielson, a specialist in African-American hip-hop culture at the University of Richmond (old school: \u201clate 1970s\u201d). \u201cThe implicit connotation is that the present is a degraded version of the past.\u201d\n\nThese days, slow-moving pre-Google pop culture feels purer, childlike and innocent \u2013 uncorrupted by the mainstream. According to Reynolds, old school as a term suggests \u201ca semi-conscious harking back to the schoolyard fun you had as kids. ... something fun, innocent and fresh.\u201d This makes particular sense in the case of hip-hop. In the 1970s, it was a small subculture found exclusively in an area of the Bronx seven miles across; by 1999, it was the top-selling musical genre in the US. The old-school hip-hop era has allure now because it was one of the last subcultures given the space and time to develop before the rest of the world saw it. \u201cWhat really defined that era was the culture of hip-hop,\u201d says Travis Gosa, associate professor of Africana studies at Cornell University (old school: \u201cbefore 1986\u201d). \u201cIt was about more than rapping: it was fashion, language, how you carried yourself.\u201d\n\nThe pivotal year, when hip-hop went overground, was perhaps 1988, when Yo! MTV Raps aired and beamed it across middle America. Nelson George (old school: \u201cbefore 1985\u201d), a hip-hop commentator since the genre\u2019s infancy, remembers first hearing the term \u201cin the 1990s when the west-coast scene was happening and there was a sense of eras passing\u201d. Old-school hip-hop \u2013 the pre-commercial world of block parties, breakdancing, graffiti \u2013 was no longer living and breathing by then. It had began to be embalmed: preserved for future generations to discover.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With a debut album released in 2004, even Kanye West can be considered old school. Photograph: Grand/Gary Calton\n\nGeorge puts the concept of old school in a longer tradition that involves fans\u2019 \u201cinstinct to capture the essence of black music\u201d and suggests it has more cultural power outside of the US. \u201cAround the world, the interest in hip-hop centres on authenticity and purity,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not unusual in African-American music \u2013 it happened with blues, jazz and soul.\u201d He namechecks northern soul: the 1970s scene in which largely white working-class Brits repurposed obscure 1960s R&B records for their party music.\n\nAs George suggests, the 1990s was the last time old school captured the zeitgeist, when Kate Moss wore Samba trainers and Run DMC\u2019s It\u2019s Like That was back in the charts thanks to a remix by Jason Nevins and a breakdancing video. It was then that Vans changed the name of the trainer formerly known as the Style 36 to the Old Skool, and St\u00fcssy produced a T-shirt emblazoned with a shaky drawing of an Adidas-like sneaker and the slogan \u201cOld Skool Flavor\u201d.\n\nMichael Kopelman (old school: \u201clate 1970s\u201d), managing director of St\u00fcssy UK, says that, at the time, the phrase was still relatively obscure. It was almost a code, a symbol of someone like-minded, worn with other signifiers like Puma Clyde trainers, leather tracksuits and Vans. \u201cAll these items were really underground, insignificant unless you knew,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what this T-shirt is. It\u2019s looking back to a time before things got commercial, mass.\u201d\n\nYo! MTV Raps pinpoints when underground hip-hop went overground.\n\nThe 1990s was when the concept of old school began to take hold in dance music, too \u2013 despite the fact that the sound being so wistfully recalled was ridiculously recent. Reynolds marvels at this shift. \u201cAll genres reach a midlife crisis, when the early days start to look better than the present,\u201d he writes in Retromania. \u201cSure enough, around 1996, you started to hear talk about \u2018old-school hardcore\u2019: veterans waxing wistfully for a golden age of rave only four years earlier.\u201d Almost 20 years later, records from the early 1990s are still played at old-school nights attended by those who were there first time around, and twentysomethings who weren\u2019t even born.\n\nFor many of the generation who grew up in the 1990s, though, the meaning of old school has shifted again. Astrid Andersen, a 29-year-old London Fashion Week menswear designer (old school: \u201c1996\u201d), whose clothes are worn by musicians including A$AP Rocky and Wiz Khalifa, namechecks \u201cPuffy, TLC, Wu-Tang Clan and Missy Elliott\u201d as her old-school references. \u201cThe scene then was so brave,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like they discovered a whole new universe. That decade will always be influential to me. When I see something from then, it makes me smile and feel good.\u201d DJ Semtex, from Radio 1Xtra, even ventures to date old school as \u201cpre-2006\u201d. \u201cI would say 2003 is old school for me because you had Ja Rule and Kanye coming up. It\u2019s a classic era.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Astrid Anderson fashion show at London Collections Men 2015. Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/REX Shutterstock/Jonathan Hordle/REX Shutterstock\n\nGeorge is sanguine about the shifting of the old-school goalposts: \u201cEvery generation uses these phrases for their own purposes.\u201d\n\nThis is not a term for purists, anyway. Old school\u2019s fluid nature plays into our desire to throw a lot of references together to see what sticks, and Semtex suggests that\u2019s part of the appeal for 1Xtra\u2019s 15- to 24-year-old core listeners: \u201cPeople are rediscovering [Air] Jordans, tracksuits, but they\u2019re doing something new with them,\u201d he says. Loren Platt (old school: \u201cearly 1980s\u201d), the 31-year-old co-founder of 90s R&B night Work It, agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s about taking references from the past and regurgitating them, making them better than the first time,\u201d she says. \u201cWe recalled the 1990s but only the bits we liked, then cut and pasted it to make something new \u2026 referencing like that now is part of youth culture.\u201d\n\nFergus Purcell (old school: \u201clate 1970s\u201d), a graphic designer who works with brands from Palace to Marc by Marc Jacobs, and his own label Aries, saw the first old-school wave in skate culture in the 1990s. He says our current pick-and-mix approach has its roots in that. \u201cCulturally, back then hip-hop represented all music in one. It was futuristic and fantastic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been catching up with that idea of taking every source and aesthetic style. Ashley Williams [fashion designer and Purcell collaborator] is someone who effortlessly channels that, but not as a distinct obsession: it\u2019s part of a menu to draw on.\u201d\n\nPurcell argues that, while old school is currently riding a wave, it \u201chasn\u2019t ever gone away. For the past 15 years, I feel culture has been blurred \u2013 there are no starts and ends to movements any more.\u201d",
