Yet minority governments are often far from impotent in the legislature. Instead, successful minority governments put together temporary coalitions with different parties on different issues, conceding enough to get their business through, and relying on the fact that the interests and preferences of opposition parties are rarely aligned.</p>\n<p>Minority administrations hold an extensive set of powerful levers simply by virtue of being in government. At Westminster, the executive tightly controls the budget process, has the ability to block non-government legislation fairly easily, retains the sole right to introduce secondary legislation (which is rarely challenged in parliament) and, despite recent reforms, can still determine the business of parliament most of the time. It makes hundreds of important public appointments, can reorganise the structure of government departments and agencies largely at will, and retains important prerogative powers over defence, foreign policy and much more.</p>\n<p>All of this illustrates that a government without a majority can still be a powerful and effective force, although its survival rests on the continued acquiescence of opposition parties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n</div>",
