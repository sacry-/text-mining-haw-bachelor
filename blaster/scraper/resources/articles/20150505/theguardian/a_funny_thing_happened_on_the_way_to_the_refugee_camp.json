I remember wondering if he was going to smile. I waved, and he waved back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But no smile; not yet anyway.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Smiles are what she and her Emirati comedian business partner and husband, Ali al-Sayed, live for. The pair, who have been taking their comedy across the Middle East and Africa for seven years, are passionate about bringing joy to communities that may not otherwise find it.</p>\n<p>But if you&#8217;d asked the couple a few years ago where they would be today, doing comedy charity work in the Middle East would not have been their answer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In 2007 I was booked to perform in Dubai as part of an arts festival,&#8221; Liccione says. &#8220;The trip was meant to be 10 days but it turned into a month as I kept getting hired to compere, teach or perform comedy. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone I met kept saying there wasn&#8217;t enough comedy here and suggested I come back and open the first comedy and urban-arts school in the region.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Which is what she did in 2008.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I took a leap of faith and came armed with tap shoes, notebooks packed with material, a clown nose and years of experience,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Back in Dubai, I started teaching comedy &#8211; stand-up, improv and physical comedy &#8211; and launched <a href=\"http://www.dubomedy.com/\" class=\" u-underline\">Dubomedy</a>, with my now husband Ali, in April 2008.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when UAE-born comedian Sayed ditched his corporate job to go funny full time. The Clowns Who Care project came about a year later, when he and Liccione decided to offer support to &#8220;centres for children and adults with special needs, senior citizens, charity organisations and hospitals&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Soon after establishing Clowns Who Care, the pair were invited to Uganda.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were helping out at the <a href=\"http://www.liveitup.org/foundation/live-it-up-uganda.html\" class=\" u-underline\">Live It Up home</a> for rescued children and were so deeply moved by the kids there that we asked what more we could do,&#8221; Liccione says. &#8220;The director said the kids get bored over the summer, so we organised an arts camp and went back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Then, in 2011, the Syrian conflict flared up.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/world/2015/may/05/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-refugee-camp#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430315770744/3d003602-d3b3-48d2-af8f-6722b7d49690-328x540.jpeg\" alt=\"Ali and a member of the audience.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48vpa%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A+funny+thing+happened+on+the+way+to+the+refugee+camp+%E2%80%A6&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48vpa%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=A+funny+thing+happened+on+the+way+to+the+refugee+camp+%E2%80%A6&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fmay%2F05%2Fa-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-refugee-camp&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F4%2F29%2F1430315771577%2F3d003602-d3b3-48d2-af8f-6722b7d49690-1241x2040.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nAli al-Sayed of Clowns Who Care with a young audience member.

With the help of the global aid agency <a href=\"https://www.mercycorps.org.uk/\" class=\" u-underline\">Mercy Corps</a>, they organised two-day sessions for young people from the 300 families living in the camp at the time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we visit these camps, we do performing-arts workshops with the kids,&#8221; Liccione explains. &#8220;We incorporate dance, music with recycled objects, physical comedy routines, acrobatics, circus skills and rhythm work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And where does the clowning come into it? &#8220;We perform for the kids too,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Our style of clowning is European, incorporating physical comedy and being a lot more neutral and community oriented, making it more inviting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sayed says the team also does &#8220;visual-arts projects with the children, which is why our suitcases are always full of paper, glue, scissors, pipe cleaners, fabric, markers and Polaroid cameras.
