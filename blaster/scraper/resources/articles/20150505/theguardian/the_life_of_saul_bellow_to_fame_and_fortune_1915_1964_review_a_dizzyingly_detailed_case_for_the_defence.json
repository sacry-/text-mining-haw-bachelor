Bellow had been staying in the city over the winter with his wife, Anita, and five-year-old son, Gregory, in order to make progress on his third novel, The Crab and the Butterfly.

As well as the gloom of Paris (&#8220;Gay Paris?&#8221; he wrote in a letter. &#8220;Gay my foot!&#8221;), he felt trapped in his marriage and stylistically confined by his first two, well-received books, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dangling-Man-Saul-Bellow/dp/0141188774/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430233850&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dangling+man\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">Dangling Man</a> and The Victim, which gave him &#8220;cherished pride in being a steady performer&#8221; and a Guggenheim fellowship to live off, but not much joy.</p>\n<p>As he walked along the street that morning, &#8220;deep in the dumps&#8221;, street cleaners were opening the hydrants and letting the water run in torrents along the gutter. It was, looking back, in that mundane vision that Bellow believed he saw his own liberation. He described the experience later to his friend Philip Roth: &#8220;I suppose a psychiatrist would say that this was some kind of hydrotherapy&#8230; but it wasn&#8217;t so much the water as the sunny iridescence&#8230; I remember saying to myself, &#8216;Well, why not take a short break and have at least as much freedom of movement as this running water?&#8217;&#8221; He determined at once to abandon his dread hospital novel. And then he recalled: &#8220;I seemed to have gone back to childhood in my thoughts and remembered a pal of mine whose surname was August &#8211; a handsome freewheeling kid who used to yell out when we were playing checkers, &#8216;I got a scheme!&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n\n<p> Related: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/17/the-five-essential-saul-bellow-novels\" class=\" u-underline\">The five essential Saul Bellow novels</a> </p>\n\n<p>Like a character out of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Bellow hurried to his writing hotel with his own &#8220;I got a scheme!&#8221; forming with &#8220;magical suddenness&#8221; in his mind, bashed out a first paragraph of the novel that was to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/09/saul-bellow-augie-march-100-best-novels-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\" class=\" u-underline\">The Adventures of Augie March</a>, and began 20 years in which he redefined the scope and soul of American fiction: &#8220;I am American, Chicago-born&#8230; and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Language, which had been dripping and trickling in Paris, in a spirit of European rationing, &#8220;rushed out of me&#8221;, he recalled, in a great midwestern dam burst. &#8220;I was turned on like a hydrant in summer.&#8221; There were waterfalls of metaphor and story everywhere: &#8220;All I had to do was be there with buckets to catch it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This epiphany comes 34 years into Bellow&#8217;s life and 371 pages into the first volume of Zachary Leader&#8217;s account of it.

Bellow&#8217;s authorised biographer has approached the task of doing full justice to the life of the &#8220;most decorated writer in American history&#8221; with an indefatigable rigour.

Bellow described his own life as one of determined disruption (&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been able to resist safety and I haven&#8217;t been able to rest in it&#8221;); the best of him, creatively, happened in the &#8220;jumps&#8221; he made, he believed.
