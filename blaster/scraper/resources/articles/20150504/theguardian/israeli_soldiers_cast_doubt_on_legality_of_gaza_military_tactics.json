Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>The testimonies raise questions whether Israel fully met its obligations to <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/9ac284404d38ed2bc1256311002afd89/50fb5579fb098faac12563cd0051dd7c\" class=\" u-underline\">protect civilians in a conflict area from unnecessary harm</a>, requiring it not only to distinguish between civilians and combatants but also ensure that when using force, where there is the risk of civilian harm, that it is &#8220;proportionate&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the main threads in the testimonies,&#8221; said Michael Sfard, an Israeli human rights lawyer and legal adviser to Breaking the Silence, &#8220;is the presumption that despite the fact that the battle was being waged in urban area &#8211; and one of most densely populated in the world &#8211; no civilians would be in the areas they entered.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p>That presumption, say soldiers, was sustained by virtue of warnings to Palestinians to leave their homes and neighbourhoods delivered in leaflets dropped by aircraft and in text and phone messages which meant &#8211; in the IDF&#8217;s interpretation &#8211; that anyone who remained was not a civilian. </p>\n<p>Even at the time that view was deeply controversial because &#8211; says Sfard and other legal experts interviewed &#8211; it reinterpreted international law regarding the duty of protection for areas containing civilians.</p>\n<p>Sfard added: &#8220;We are not talking about a [deliberate] decision to kill civilians. But to say the rules of engagement were lax gives them too much credit. They allowed engagement in almost any circumstances, unless there was a felt to be a risk to an IDF soldier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the rules of engagement were highly permissive, other soldiers say that they also detected a darker mood in their units that further coloured the way that soldiers behaved. &#8220;The motto guiding lots of people was: &#8216;Let&#8217;s show them,&#8217; recalls a lieutenant who served in the Givati Brigade in Rafah. &#8220;It was evident that was a starting point. Lots of guys who did their reserve duty with me don&#8217;t have much pity towards [the Palestinians].&#8221;</p>\n<p>He added: &#8220;There were a lot of people there who really hate Arabs. Really, really hate Arabs. You could see the hate in their eyes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A second lieutenant echoed his comments. &#8220;You could feel there was a radicalisation in the way the whole thing was conducted. The discourse was extremely rightwing ... [And] the very fact that [Palestinians were] described as &#8216;uninvolved&#8217; rather than as civilians, and the desensitisation to the surging number of dead on the Palestinian side. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether they&#8217;re involved or not &#8230; that&#8217;s something that troubles me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/world/2015/may/04/israeli-soldiers-cast-doubt-on-legality-of-gaza-military-operation#img-4\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430460814368/54173b75-29cd-4b34-8fa0-59f9e138c93f-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"A group of Palestinian children and teenagers rescue possessions from a devastated area of northern Gaza during a ceasefire in last summer's summer's war.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x3y%2Fsfb%23img-4&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Israeli+soldiers+cast+doubt+on+legality+of+Gaza+military+tactics&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F48x3y%2Fstw%23img-4\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Israeli+soldiers+cast+doubt+on+legality+of+Gaza+military+tactics&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fmay%2F04%2Fisraeli-soldiers-cast-doubt-on-legality-of-gaza-military-operation&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F1%2F1430460815050%2Fef440122-e4b7-4040-ad4b-b004b25d8c9e-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nA group of Palestinian children and teenagers rescue possessions from a devastated area of northern Gaza during a ceasefire in last summer&#8217;s summer&#8217;s war. Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Guardian\n\n\n\n<p>And the testimonies, too, suggest breaches of the IDF&#8217;s own code of ethics &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.idf.il/1497-en/Dover.aspx\" class=\" u-underline\">The Spirit of the IDF</a> &#8211; which insists: &#8220;IDF soldiers will not use their weapons and force to harm human beings who are not combatants or prisoners of war, and will do all in their power to avoid causing harm to their lives, bodies, dignity and property.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contrary to that, however, testimonies describe how soldiers randomly shelled buildings either to no obvious military purpose or for revenge.<br></p>\n<p>One sergeant who served in a tank in the centre of the Gaza Strip recalls: &#8220;A week or two after we entered the Gaza Strip and we were all firing a lot when there wasn&#8217;t any need for it &#8211; just for the sake of firing &#8211; a member of our company was killed.<br></p>\n<p>&#8220;The company commander came over to us and told us that one guy was killed due to such-and-such, and he said: &#8216;Guys, get ready, get in your tanks, and we&#8217;ll fire a barrage in memory of our comrade&#8221; &#8230; My tank went up to the post &#8211; a place from which I can see targets &#8211; can see buildings &#8211; [and] fired at them, and the platoon commander says: &#8216;OK guys, we&#8217;ll now fire in memory of our comrade&#8217; and we said OK.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p>How Israeli forces used artillery and mortars in Gaza, says Breaking the Silence, has raised other concerns beyond either the rules of engagement or the actions of specific units.<br></p>\n<p>According to the group&#8217;s research during the war, the Israeli military operated two different sets of rules for how close certain weapons could be fired to Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians.<br></p>\n<p>Yehuda Shaul, one of the founders of Breaking the Silence, and himself a former soldier, explains: &#8220;What our research during this project uncovered was that there were three designated &#8216;Operational Levels&#8217; during the conflict &#8211; numbered one to three. What the operational level was was set higher up the chain of command. Above the level of the Gaza division. What those levels do is designate the likelihood of civilian casualties from weapons like 155mm artillery and bombs from &#8216;low&#8217; damage to civilians to &#8216;high&#8217;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we established was that for artillery fire in operational levels two and three Israeli forces were allowed to fire much closer to civilians than they were to friendly Israeli forces.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p>Ahead of the conflict &#8211; in which 34,000 shells were fired into Gaza, 19,000 of them explosive &#8211; artillery and air liaison officers had been supplied with a list of sensitive sites to which fire was not to be directed within clear limits of distance. These included hospitals and UN schools being used as refugee centres, even in areas where evacuation had been ordered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even then,&#8221; explains Shaul, &#8220;we have a testimony we took that a senior brigade commander issued order how to get around that, instructing that the unit fired first outside of the protected area and then calling for correction fire on to the location that they wanted to hit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He said: &#8220;If you go on the radio and ask to hit this building, we have to say no. But if you give a target 200 metres outside then you can ask for correction. Only thing that is recorded is the first target not the correction fire.&#8221;<br></p>\n<p>And in the end, despite the high number of civilian casualties, the debriefings treated the destruction as an accomplishment that would discourage Hamas in the future. </p>\n<p>&#8220;You could say they went over most of the things viewed as accomplishments,&#8221; said a Combat Intelligence Corps sergeant. &#8220; &#8220;They spoke about numbers: 2,000 dead and 11,000 wounded, half a million refugees, decades worth of destruction. Harm to lots of senior Hamas members and to their homes, to their families. These were stated as accomplishments so that no one would doubt that what we did during this period was meaningful. </p>\n<p>&#8220;They spoke of a five-year period of quiet (in which there would be no hostilities between Israel and Hamas) when in fact it was a 72-hour ceasefire, and at the end of those 72 hours they were firing again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Without responding to the specific allegations, the Israeli military said: &#8220;The IDF is committed to properly investigating all credible claims raised via media, NGOs, and official complaints concerning IDF conduct during operation Protective Edge, in as serious a manner as possible. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It should be noted that following Operation Protective Edge, thorough investigations were carried out, and soldiers and commanders were given the opportunity to present any complaint. Exceptional incidents were then transferred to the military advocate general for further inquiry.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<br>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Guardian\n\nThe testimonies raise questions whether Israel fully met its obligations to protect civilians in a conflict area from unnecessary harm, requiring it not only to distinguish between civilians and combatants but also ensure that when using force, where there is the risk of civilian harm, that it is \u201cproportionate\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne of the main threads in the testimonies,\u201d said Michael Sfard, an Israeli human rights lawyer and legal adviser to Breaking the Silence, \u201cis the presumption that despite the fact that the battle was being waged in urban area \u2013 and one of most densely populated in the world \u2013 no civilians would be in the areas they entered.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat presumption, say soldiers, was sustained by virtue of warnings to Palestinians to leave their homes and neighbourhoods delivered in leaflets dropped by aircraft and in text and phone messages which meant \u2013 in the IDF\u2019s interpretation \u2013 that anyone who remained was not a civilian.\n\nEven at the time that view was deeply controversial because \u2013 says Sfard and other legal experts interviewed \u2013 it reinterpreted international law regarding the duty of protection for areas containing civilians.\n\nSfard added: \u201cWe are not talking about a [deliberate] decision to kill civilians. But to say the rules of engagement were lax gives them too much credit. They allowed engagement in almost any circumstances, unless there was a felt to be a risk to an IDF soldier.\u201d\n\nIf the rules of engagement were highly permissive, other soldiers say that they also detected a darker mood in their units that further coloured the way that soldiers behaved. \u201cThe motto guiding lots of people was: \u2018Let\u2019s show them,\u2019 recalls a lieutenant who served in the Givati Brigade in Rafah. \u201cIt was evident that was a starting point. Lots of guys who did their reserve duty with me don\u2019t have much pity towards [the Palestinians].\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere were a lot of people there who really hate Arabs. Really, really hate Arabs. You could see the hate in their eyes.\u201d\n\nA second lieutenant echoed his comments. \u201cYou could feel there was a radicalisation in the way the whole thing was conducted. The discourse was extremely rightwing ... [And] the very fact that [Palestinians were] described as \u2018uninvolved\u2019 rather than as civilians, and the desensitisation to the surging number of dead on the Palestinian side. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re involved or not \u2026 that\u2019s something that troubles me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A group of Palestinian children and teenagers rescue possessions from a devastated area of northern Gaza during a ceasefire in last summer\u2019s summer\u2019s war. Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Guardian\n\nAnd the testimonies, too, suggest breaches of the IDF\u2019s own code of ethics \u2013 The Spirit of the IDF \u2013 which insists: \u201cIDF soldiers will not use their weapons and force to harm human beings who are not combatants or prisoners of war, and will do all in their power to avoid causing harm to their lives, bodies, dignity and property.\u201d\n\nContrary to that, however, testimonies describe how soldiers randomly shelled buildings either to no obvious military purpose or for revenge.\n\n\n\nOne sergeant who served in a tank in the centre of the Gaza Strip recalls: \u201cA week or two after we entered the Gaza Strip and we were all firing a lot when there wasn\u2019t any need for it \u2013 just for the sake of firing \u2013 a member of our company was killed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe company commander came over to us and told us that one guy was killed due to such-and-such, and he said: \u2018Guys, get ready, get in your tanks, and we\u2019ll fire a barrage in memory of our comrade\u201d \u2026 My tank went up to the post \u2013 a place from which I can see targets \u2013 can see buildings \u2013 [and] fired at them, and the platoon commander says: \u2018OK guys, we\u2019ll now fire in memory of our comrade\u2019 and we said OK.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow Israeli forces used artillery and mortars in Gaza, says Breaking the Silence, has raised other concerns beyond either the rules of engagement or the actions of specific units.\n\n\n\nAccording to the group\u2019s research during the war, the Israeli military operated two different sets of rules for how close certain weapons could be fired to Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians.\n\n\n\nYehuda Shaul, one of the founders of Breaking the Silence, and himself a former soldier, explains: \u201cWhat our research during this project uncovered was that there were three designated \u2018Operational Levels\u2019 during the conflict \u2013 numbered one to three. What the operational level was was set higher up the chain of command. Above the level of the Gaza division. What those levels do is designate the likelihood of civilian casualties from weapons like 155mm artillery and bombs from \u2018low\u2019 damage to civilians to \u2018high\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhat we established was that for artillery fire in operational levels two and three Israeli forces were allowed to fire much closer to civilians than they were to friendly Israeli forces.\u201d\n\n\n\nAhead of the conflict \u2013 in which 34,000 shells were fired into Gaza, 19,000 of them explosive \u2013 artillery and air liaison officers had been supplied with a list of sensitive sites to which fire was not to be directed within clear limits of distance. These included hospitals and UN schools being used as refugee centres, even in areas where evacuation had been ordered.\n\n\u201cEven then,\u201d explains Shaul, \u201cwe have a testimony we took that a senior brigade commander issued order how to get around that, instructing that the unit fired first outside of the protected area and then calling for correction fire on to the location that they wanted to hit.\n\n\u201cHe said: \u201cIf you go on the radio and ask to hit this building, we have to say no. But if you give a target 200 metres outside then you can ask for correction. Only thing that is recorded is the first target not the correction fire.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd in the end, despite the high number of civilian casualties, the debriefings treated the destruction as an accomplishment that would discourage Hamas in the future.\n\n\u201cYou could say they went over most of the things viewed as accomplishments,\u201d said a Combat Intelligence Corps sergeant. \u201c \u201cThey spoke about numbers: 2,000 dead and 11,000 wounded, half a million refugees, decades worth of destruction. Harm to lots of senior Hamas members and to their homes, to their families. These were stated as accomplishments so that no one would doubt that what we did during this period was meaningful.\n\n\u201cThey spoke of a five-year period of quiet (in which there would be no hostilities between Israel and Hamas) when in fact it was a 72-hour ceasefire, and at the end of those 72 hours they were firing again.\u201d\n\nWithout responding to the specific allegations, the Israeli military said: \u201cThe IDF is committed to properly investigating all credible claims raised via media, NGOs, and official complaints concerning IDF conduct during operation Protective Edge, in as serious a manner as possible.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that following Operation Protective Edge, thorough investigations were carried out, and soldiers and commanders were given the opportunity to present any complaint. Exceptional incidents were then transferred to the military advocate general for further inquiry.\u201d\n\n\n\n",
