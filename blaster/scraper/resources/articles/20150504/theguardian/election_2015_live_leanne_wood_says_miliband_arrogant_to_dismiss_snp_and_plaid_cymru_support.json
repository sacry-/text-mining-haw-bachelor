Most are held by the Lib Dems, including Eastbourne, Bath, Chippenham, Cheadle, Twickenham, and Kingston and Surbiton.\n\nAnd the Times (paywall) has \u201csenior Labour figures\u201d warning Miliband against trying to form a minority government if he doesn\u2019t beat Cameron to the most MPs.\n\nAndrew Rawnsley\u2019s guide to what happens next once the votes are counted is definitely worth a read before Thursday.\n\nRead these\n\nNicholas Watt in this here Guardian notes that the Tory right has been ominously quiet during the campaign:\n\nIf the Tories have lost a significant number of seats \u2013 about 30, to take their numbers down to 276 \u2013 then Cameron\u2019s position may become complicated at the 1922 meeting on Monday. Cameron may try to hold on.\n\nBut one idea doing the rounds is that some on the right might try to install Boris Johnson as Tory leader before a second election in October. In the meantime, Cameron would remain as a caretaker prime minister.\n\nWriting in the Times, Tim Montgomerie says the system is unfair to Ukip and the Greens:\n\nThe old left-right divides are increasingly obsolete. The new questions involve localism versus centralism; intergenerational fairness; openness to the world or isolationism; and debates as to whether the individual matters most in public policy or that family and community do. These questions often divide rather than unite existing parties. Personally, I\u2019d vote for a eurosceptic, Christian Democratic-style party. Under a PR system I might have that option.\n\n\n\nLesley Riddoch in the Scotsman says the result in Scotland is pretty much a foregone conclusion:\n\nWith three days to go, it\u2019s the mood south of the Border that\u2019s now more interesting. While English political leaders, commentators and money experts are predicting Britain will go to hell in a handcart if the SNP plays any policy-making role in government, English voters themselves seem far less perturbed. Indeed some \u2013 clearly feeling cheated they cannot vote for the SNP and the UK\u2019s most popular party leader \u2013 have begun asking pointed questions about the shortcomings of English democracy instead.\n\nThe day in a tweet\n\nScottish Labour leader Jim Murphy reveals what gets politicians, reporters and live bloggers through the last week of the election campaign (mine\u2019s a Diet Coke):\n\n\u2014 Jim Murphy (@JimForScotland) A few midnight 'health' snacks to keep me going whilst I campaign for @scottishlabour overnight tonight. pic.twitter.com/knwxqMhUn8\n\nIf today were a song, it would be\u2026\n\nMonday Monday by The Mamas & The Papas: \u201cOh, Monday morning, you gave me no warning of what was to be.\u201d\n\nWhenever Monday comes, you can find me crying all of the time.\n\nThe key story you\u2019re missing when you\u2019re election-obsessed\n\nToday could be the day we find out the name of the new baby \u2026 ha, sorry, just kidding. It\u2019s May the Fourth, which means Star Wars news, which is that the eighth instalment of the series is to be filmed in the UK, at Pinewood.",
