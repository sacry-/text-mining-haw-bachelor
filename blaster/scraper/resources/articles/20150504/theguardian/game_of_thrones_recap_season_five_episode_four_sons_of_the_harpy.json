So it swiftly proved, as Cersei&#8217;s decision to reinstitute the Faith Militant kicked off a series of raids culminating in the imprisonment of Loras Tyrell for &#8220;breaking the laws of gods and men&#8221;. Loras&#8217;s arrest was clearly what Cersei was hoping for when she hinted to the High Sparrow that the greatest sinners could be found in the highest places, and she&#8217;d already weakened Margaery&#8217;s power base by sending Mace Tyrell to Braavos to negotiate with the Iron Bank. Round Two to the Queen Mother then &#8230; or is it?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d contend that Cersei&#8217;s biggest problem is that she&#8217;s a bad chess player, only capable of thinking one move ahead. Thus, instead of hugging close the stupid platitude-spouting Mace, a man who is clearly unable to aid his daughter in any meaningful way, she sent him away, creating a Tyrell vacuum that Margaery is clearly hoping to fill with the rather more astute presence of her grandmother. Furthermore, the arrest of Loras, while infuriating Margaery as intended, did little to help Tommen&#8217;s status as king, instead forcing him into a position of confrontation on the steps of the High Sept, from which, not being his psychotic dead brother, he could do nothing but back down.</p>\n<p>That confrontation on the Sept demonstrated Cersei&#8217;s poor forward planning: she has just armed a group of crazed religious fanatics while hinting that there&#8217;s all manner of sin lurking amid the King&#8217;s Landing aristocracy, then she engineers a position in which her son is sent out to the city where he is branded an abomination by the watching crowd. Just how long is it likely to be before the kindly High Sparrow turns his grand inquisitorial eye closer to home?</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/04/game-of-thrones-recap-season-five-episode-four-sons-of-the-harpy#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430487833548/e40dab95-172d-4bcc-adb2-6b9024a31460-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F482bf%2Fsfb%23img-2&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Game+of+Thrones+recap%3A+season+five%2C+episode+four+%E2%80%93+Sons+of+the+Harpy&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F482bf%2Fstw%23img-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Game+of+Thrones+recap%3A+season+five%2C+episode+four+%E2%80%93+Sons+of+the+Harpy&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftv-and-radio%2Ftvandradioblog%2F2015%2Fmay%2F04%2Fgame-of-thrones-recap-season-five-episode-four-sons-of-the-harpy&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F1%2F1430487834167%2Fe40dab95-172d-4bcc-adb2-6b9024a31460-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nJonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow.

But, oh, if they did then there would be songs aplenty sung to Barristan Selmy, the last of the true Kingsguards, a man who did his best to serve with honour, even if those he guarded were often unworthy. Way back in the first season Ned Stark said to Barristan: &#8220;My father once told me you were the best he&#8217;d ever seen&#8221;, and this episode gave us the truth of that as Barristan came valiantly to the outnumbered Grey Worm&#8217;s aid, giving his own life in the process. It was a noble death for a man who was a soldier of the old school, although personally I&#8217;m with the pragmatic Bronn and his dreams of dying old and rich with his children squabbling at his bedside. </p>\n<p>More importantly, what does that death mean for Dany? The way in which the Sons of the Harpy trapped the Unsullied was a classic of guerrilla warfare employed everywhere from the <a href=\"http://%20http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/life-in-divis-flats\" class=\" u-underline\">Divis Flats</a> in Belfast in the 1970s to the back streets of Baghdad, which suggests that things aren&#8217;t going to improve any time soon. Of equal concern is the fact her advisers are dropping faster than flies; it&#8217;s all very well being hailed as a saviour by travelling preachers, but I&#8217;m beginning to wonder if there&#8217;s going to be anything left of Meereen by the time Jorah and Tyrion arrive.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/04/game-of-thrones-recap-season-five-episode-four-sons-of-the-harpy#img-3\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\"><img src=\"//i.guim.co.uk/static/w-300/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430494938118/cac111fd-0bec-496f-a582-4cd203cfd8fb-300x180.jpeg\" alt=\"Nathalie Emmanuel as Missandei and Jacob Anderson as Grey Worm.\" class=\"gu-image\"><p class=\"rounded-icon article__fullscreen\"><i class=\"i i-expand-white\"></i><i class=\"i i-expand-black\"></i></p></a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--facebook js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F482bf%2Fsfb%23img-3&amp;ref=responsive\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Facebook</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--twitter js-blockshare-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Game+of+Thrones+recap%3A+season+five%2C+episode+four+%E2%80%93+Sons+of+the+Harpy&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F482bf%2Fstw%23img-3\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Twitter</p> </a>\n<a class=\"rounded-icon block-share__item block-share__item--pinterest js-blockshare-link\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Game+of+Thrones+recap%3A+season+five%2C+episode+four+%E2%80%93+Sons+of+the+Harpy&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftv-and-radio%2Ftvandradioblog%2F2015%2Fmay%2F04%2Fgame-of-thrones-recap-season-five-episode-four-sons-of-the-harpy&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F5%2F1%2F1430494938722%2Fcac111fd-0bec-496f-a582-4cd203cfd8fb-2060x1236.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> <i class=\"i\"></i><p class=\"u-h\">Pinterest</p> </a>\n\nNathalie Emmanuel as Missandei and Jacob Anderson as Grey Worm.

Her subsequent hug just about broke me. Oh, Stannis: if it weren&#8217;t for that whole murdering your brother with an evil shadow baby thing, I&#8217;d really be rooting for you to win the ultimate game.
