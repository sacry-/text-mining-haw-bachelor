I&#8217;ve been to these stores a half dozen times and I&#160;can tell you that they are, indeed, very nice &#8211; if you want to look like the Duchess of Cambridge or Samantha Cameron and don&#8217;t mind spending three figures on a dress you&#8217;ll wear for about five months. Both stores have some useful wrap dresses (although, honestly, you can buy those anywhere), but, in the case of S&#233;raphine, it is undeniably Sloaney, with all those floral sleeveless dresses (what pregnant woman wants to go sleeveless?) and patterned slacks (and what pregnant woman wants to wear patterns across her arse?). Just going into S&#233;raphine brings back memories of the one time I tried to find a dress at LK Bennett on Sloane Street (I was 21, I thought that was how I was meant to dress for job interviews.) So if&#160;that&#8217;s your bag, great. If not, jog on. Isabella Oliver is better, but still crazy expensive, considering you won&#8217;t be able to wear the clothes in a year&#8217;s time.</p>\n<p>Then we move on to high-street maternity clothes, as sold by the likes of Topshop, Next, New Look, H&amp;M and so on. These aren&#8217;t terrible, and you can get decent maternity jeans in these places (Leigh jeans at Topshop are the best), but the inevitable yet sad truth is that their selections are relatively small. Well, of course they are: these retailers do, after all, have fewer pregnant customers than non-pregnant ones. But this does mean that a pregnant woman ends up buying something she doesn&#8217;t really like, just because she needs to wear some damn thing. And that can be a very weird sensation because most women, whether into fashion or not, make a personal statement through their clothing, even if it&#8217;s just: &#8220;I&#8217;m a mainstream funky pigeon who likes Breton tops.&#8221; So to be denied that, and forced into clothes you&#8217;d never usually wear, is disconcerting.</p>\n<p>But, in a weird way, this, too, prepares a woman for motherhood. As&#160;many others have noted, there&#8217;s nothing like having a baby to make a woman feel like she&#8217;s lost her identity. You&#8217;re no longer your name &#8211; you&#8217;re the mum of your child. If anything newsworthy happens to you for the rest of your life, the papers will describe you as &#8216;mum&#8217;, as in &#8220;Manchester mum wins the lottery!&#8221; Clearly, this is bizarre, but it&#8217;s funny how well maternity clothes prepare a woman for this, with their forced and restrictive identity.
