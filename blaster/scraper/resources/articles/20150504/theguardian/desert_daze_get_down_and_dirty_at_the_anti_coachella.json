Now in its fourth year and held over 24 hours, the event took place on Saturday (2 May) in Mecca &#8211; a brutally hot, eerie dustbowl in the middle of the California desert.</p>\n<p>The site isn&#8217;t far from <a href=\"http://www.abdsp.org/\" class=\" u-underline\">Anza-Borrego Park</a>, filming location for The X Files. As that show promised &#8220;the truth is out there&#8221; so does Desert Daze. Under the sole light of a full moon and with the aid of a DIY aesthetic created by arts collective <a href=\"http://moonblockparty.org/\" class=\" u-underline\">Moon Block</a>, 3,500 music fans enjoyed an experience akin to the way music festivals must have been in their infancy. Even if attendees struggled to remember it the next day, there was a truth out there, somewhere, involving a mascot dressed as an eyeball; a miasma of underground freak-rock acts named <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/flyinghair\" class=\" u-underline\">Flying Hair</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/DAHGA-BLOOM/118375341529984\" class=\" u-underline\">Dahga Bloom</a> and <a href=\"https://dirtdress.bandcamp.com/\" class=\" u-underline\">Dirt Dress</a>; and a hefty amount of potent weirdness. Call it the anti-Coachella.</p>\n<p>The organisers are Julie Edwards (drummer in heavy rock duo <a href=\"http://www.deapvally.com/\" class=\" u-underline\">Deap Vally</a>) and her husband Phil Pironne of LA-based band <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjuujjuu_band\" class=\" u-underline\">JJUUJJUU</a>. Together they&#8217;ve channeled their knowledge of the festival circuit into a positive-thinking, purist and shambolic celebration. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s stressful but I do enjoy it,&#8221; says Julie, taking a 30-second breather at a tiny backstage poolhouse, temporary home to a growing Moon Block crew. They include an ice-cream vendor whose job is to deliver free scoops all day; Monica, who has &#8220;no title&#8221; but is getting artists and their equipment to stages on foot because of the dearth of golf-carts; and campsite manager The Art whose party trick is shaking the dust out of his wizard-like beard. Together, the Moon Block family make the pilgrimage here for a week to set up a psych-rock kibbutz for friends and intrepid fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;None of us are professional,&#8221; says site manager Bill. &#8220;We&#8217;re a tight group trying to make something work.&#8221; Everyone chips in onstage as well as off. During a mid-afternoon set, Mish Way, singer of <a href=\"https://whitelung.bandcamp.com/\" class=\" u-underline\">White Lung</a>, takes to her platform with one member of her band down and announces, &#8220;Meet our new bassist! Lindsey of Deap Vally! She&#8217;s perfect!&#8221; </p>\n<p>Despite killing it, Lindsey Troy breathes a sigh of relief backstage having gotten through the set without a hiccup. But even if there had been errors, you get the impression nobody would bat an eyelid. Desert Daze&#8217;s spirit is enveloped in a collective sense of togetherness. Everyone&#8217;s friends here, crowd and lineup included. Whenever something goes awry someone tries to solve it &#8211; usually Julie.</p>\n<p>The drummer-turned-onsite-matriarch spends all day running around with a walkie-talkie in one hand and a clipboard in the other, putting out fires everywhere. She helps vendors set up, checks on sound problems, deals with medical issues (which are rare) and prays for a full moon in case there aren&#8217;t enough fairy lights to illuminate the site as it grows dustier, dirtier and ever more insane. When Lindsey takes to the stage for Deap Vally&#8217;s own set around 9.30pm in a star-spangled Wonder Woman suit, it&#8217;s clear the woman sitting on the drum-riser should be wearing a Captain America onesie to match.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the late afternoon when Desert Daze starts to grow tentacles. At around 4.30pm, the attending teenagers and twentysomething non-hipsters evolve. Strangers start winking at each other and spinning each other around. &#8220;YES! THE EYEBALL GUY!&#8221; shouts one onlooker, au fait with the festival mascot from years previous. &#8220;Eyeball guy&#8221; wears a hard hat beneath the eyeball head due to its crushing weight. I follow him to the Party Stage where there&#8217;s a moving screen for a backdrop, created by a guy mixing oils on a plate in time-honoured 60s style.
