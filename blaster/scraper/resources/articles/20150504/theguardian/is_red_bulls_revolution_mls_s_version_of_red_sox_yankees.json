The focus will be on New York next week, but when both teams look up again Seattle could be over the horizon. <strong>GP</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Chris Rolfe and Fabian Espindola partnership gives DC United fresh edge</strong></h2>\n<p>Fabian Espindola had a lot of time to devise his comeback. Sat in the stands, gritting his teeth over a suspension he never truly accepted, the Argentinian striker must have played over countless triumphant rebound scenarios in his head. As a key figure of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/dcunited\" class=\" u-underline\">DC United</a> lineup his return was always likely to bolster Ben Olsen&#8217;s side, but perhaps not even Espindola could have envisaged the impact his return from a six-match ban would have.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if DC United looked like conference challengers before, then they may even be frontrunners with Espindola back in the team &#8211; with the 29-year-old scoring in the surprisingly comprehensive 2-0 win over the Columbus Crew Saturday. DC United have impressed on a number of occasions this season, but this was their most consistent and complete performance of the campaign so far. </p>\n<p>And Espindola was the driving force behind that display, although he certainly had some help from his team-mate Chris Rolfe - with whom the Argentinian is forming quite the partnership, at least on the basis of their last two outings. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy for me to play with Fabi,&#8221; gushed Rolfe after the win. &#8220;If I get the ball I just know that I have to find him, and he&#8217;ll take care of the rest. He makes it pretty easy at times, honestly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DC United&#8217;s opener against the Crew was illustrative of the innate threat now carried in attack between Espindola and Rolfe. With Columbus caught up the field, DC snapped on the counterattack &#8211; with Rolfe surging 40 yards into the opposition half to seek out Espindola, who found the net with an angled left-footed strike to the far post. &#8220;His work rate was phenomenal, he set me up perfectly,&#8221; said Espindola, returning his partner&#8217;s compliment and underlining their developing bromance.</p>\n<p>The former Red Bulls forward added an assist to his personal scorecard four minutes before the interval too, whipping in the corner kick from which Sean Franklin guided home the game&#8217;s second. It is a peculiar quirk of DC United&#8217;s season that by scoring his first league goal of the campaign Saturday Espindola became the club&#8217;s top scorer in 2015 &#8211; with four in all competitions, including two in the Concacaf Champions League. Yet his attacking contribution goes deeper than his goal tally.</p>\n<p>But while the hosts kept their 15-game RFK unbeaten run going, the Columbus Crew suffered their first defeat since March. The Black and Gold controlled much of the possession, but never looked in control of the contest &#8211; with DC United playing the game they clearly planned for. Having scored seven over their past two games, Gregg Berhalter&#8217;s side struggled to get in behind the DC backline &#8211; with the front four of Kei Kamara, Federico Higuain, Justin Meram and Ethan Finlay producing just one shot on goal between them. The Crew&#8217;s attacking productivity (or lack of) was in stark contrast to that of Espindola and Rolfe. <strong>GR</strong><br></p>\n<h2><strong>New England Revolution provide genuine rivalry for the Red Bulls</strong></h2>\n<p>East coast rivalry in MLS will take on a new element next week when the New York Red Bulls and New York City FC clash for the first time. But Jermaine Jones believes there already exists a simmering rivalry in the East, describing Saturday&#8217;s contest between the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/newenglandrevolution\" class=\" u-underline\">New England Revolution</a> and the Red Bulls in the context of another great sporting conflict. &#8220;You can see it the same as in baseball with Red Sox-Yankees,&#8221; said the midfielder after the Revs&#8217; 2-1 win. &#8220;So maybe we have that with the New York Red Bulls.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And Saturday&#8217;s clash between the Revolution and the Red Bulls was indeed a conflict. &#8220;It was a chippy game,&#8221; said New York head coach Jesse Marsch, understating what had been a distinctly ill-tempered affair which was capped by a scuffle sparked at full-time between the two teams, with Jones and Red Bulls midfielder Felipe Martins the primary protagonists. &#8220;Postgame Jermaine Jones was being a little cheeky and wanted to be clever and talk a little bit of junk to Felipe and touch his face and I didn&#8217;t like that,&#8221; explained Sacha Kljestan. &#8220;I told [Felipe] that if you lose, it&#8217;s better you don&#8217;t talk,&#8221; said Jones. Such post-match bickering was reflective of the game&#8217;s lasting tone.</p>\n<p>Nobody seems sure of what Sunday&#8217;s clash between the Red Bulls and NYC FC will offer. Most derbies have their basis in a mutual abhorrence - but how can either team hold a sporting rhetoric when they have never played each other before? Will there be the intensity of a traditional derby match? It could be the case that the East has already staged its newest and fiercest rivalry, between the New England Revolution and the New York Red Bulls. Soccer&#8217;s Red Sox v Yankees equivalent, as Jones put it.</p>\n<p>Marsch now heads into the clash against NYC FC having suffered his first MLS defeat as Red Bulls boss, although with Bradley Wright-Phillips and Lloyd Sam rested from the onset - after three matches in just seven days - a narrow road loss to the conference leaders certainly isn&#8217;t an indignity. Despite the result, New York did enough to maintain their position as one of the league&#8217;s hottest teams right now.</p>\n<p>Not the hottest though. That intangible accolade goes to New England, who have now won five and drawn one of their opening six league games this season. Charlie Davies&#8217; diving header would have been the highlight of the Revs&#8217; victory at Gillette on Saturday, had it not been for his celebration. The striker marked his opening goal by imitating a matador, illustrating that the Revolution, more than any other team, flutters a red rag at the Red Bulls. <strong>GR</strong><br></p>\n<h2><strong>The Portland Timbers are dependent on Diego Valeri to turn things around</strong></h2>\n<p>As far as Cascadia Cup games go, this was something of an anomaly. In five such matches last season the Vancouver Whitecaps shared 25 goals between themselves, the Portland Timbers and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/seattle-sounders\" class=\" u-underline\">Seattle Sounders</a>. Goals and drama are all but assured when the Pacific north-west&#8217;s MLS teams clash. Not this time, though.</p>\n<p>The Timbers and the Whitecaps played out a rather zestless goalless draw at Providence Park Saturday, with the match proving something of an anticlimax for those expecting another enthralling Cascadia Cup clash.

Portland set a precedent for the league, and yet the Timbers has now played more long balls than any other side in the league, besides New England (both teams have 77 for the season). The return of Diego Valeri &#8211; who missed the first two months of the campaign as he recovered from an ACL injury &#8211; should help address that.</p>\n<p>The Argentinian will provide a degree of subtlety and intelligence that Portland has desperately lacked in 2015, potentially pushing Nagbe to the wings or further up the field in order accommodate Valeri in in his natural No10 position. Of course, Valeri shouldn&#8217;t be expected to make an immediate impact &#8211; given the severity of the injury he has had to overcome over the past few months &#8211; although his cameo appearance against the Whitecaps was enough to suggest that in the longer-term he will make a difference, even if Porter must manage his reintroduction carefully.</p>\n<p>However, Portland&#8217;s problems won&#8217;t be solved merely through Valeri&#8217;s return. Creating goalscoring opportunities hasn&#8217;t been much of an issue for Porter&#8217;s side, but taking them certainly has. Fanendo Adi has three goals to his name this season but beyond the Nigerian, Portland is hardly awash with reliable goalscorers. &#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time,&#8221; said Porter, hardly hiding his relief at the second half performance of his Argentinian playmaker. Valeri won&#8217;t necessarily boost the Timbers&#8217; goal tally on his own, but his return should at least give Porter&#8217;s side a sense of their identity again. <strong>GR</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Dallas back to peak efficiency</strong></h2>\n<p>When Fabian Castillo&#8217;s audacious toe poke off the outside of his boot flashed across the luckless Tyler Deric on Friday, it was FC Dallas&#8217;s fourth goal of the game from their fifth shot on goal.</p>\n<p>It was the second successive game that Houston had shipped four goals, but while they buzzed around in lively fashion in the Dallas half throughout the evening, they were up against a less generous opponent than Kansas City last week (where they at least scored four of their own).
